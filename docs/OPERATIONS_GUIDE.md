## Common Edit Recipes (Fast Path)

Use this table when you already know **what changed** and need the shortest safe path.

| Change type | Usually edit | Must run | Usually inspect next |
|-------------|-------------|----------|----------------------|
| Manual event / paredão / prova / poll data | `data/manual_events.json`, `data/paredoes.json`, `data/provas.json`, `data/votalhada/polls.json` | `python scripts/build_derived_data.py` | `docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md` + affected page |
| Shared scoring / loader / date logic | `scripts/data_utils.py`, `scripts/builders/*`, `scripts/derived_pipeline.py` | targeted `pytest` + `python scripts/build_derived_data.py` | affected derived JSON + affected page |
| Reusable render helper | `scripts/*_viz.py` | targeted `pytest` + `python scripts/quarto_render_safe.py <affected-page>.qmd` | rendered HTML / page screenshots |
| Page-only composition / prose / layout | `*.qmd`, `assets/*`, `_quarto.yml` | targeted `pytest` + `python scripts/quarto_render_safe.py <affected-page>.qmd` | local page render and, when needed, screenshot capture |
| Git/publication workflow | `.githooks/pre-push`, `.github/workflows/public-policy-report.yml`, `scripts/sync_public.sh` (legacy), workflow docs | `bash -n .githooks/pre-push` when the hook changes; `pytest tests/test_sync_public_script.py -q` only if the legacy helper changed | push policy and legacy recovery flow |
| Documentation only | `README.md`, `docs/*.md`, `data/votalhada/README.md` | consistency check of links/cross-references | no site rebuild required unless instructions or examples changed materially |

For the exact test families and recommended commands, see `docs/TESTING.md`.

## Agent: Web Scraping & Source Collection

**CRITICAL**: GShow (gshow.globo.com) and other Globo properties **cannot be fetched via WebFetch, web scraping AI tools, or direct HTTP clients**. These domains block automated access. **Always use the project's dedicated scraper**:

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<url>" -o docs/scraped/
```

The scraper uses Playwright (headless browser) to render the page and extract content as Markdown. Output goes to `docs/scraped/` (gitignored, local reference only).

### Source images (broadcast screenshots, Twitter/X)

When prova results, duel scores, or other game data are captured as screenshots:

1. **Never leave images at the repo root.** Move them immediately to `docs/scraped/` with descriptive names:
   ```
   prova_anjo_9_qf1_leandro_vs_jonas.jpeg    # format: prova_{tipo}_{numero}_{fase}_{description}
   prova_lider_8_fase1_grupo4.jpeg
   ```
2. **Use Claude Code's vision** (Read tool on image files) to extract scores, names, and results from screenshots.
3. **Create an archive file** for social media sources: `docs/scraped/prova_{tipo}_{numero}_twitter_{account}.md` with tweets in chronological order, extracted scores, and image cross-references.
4. **Add to `fontes`** in `provas.json` or `manual_events.json`:
   ```json
   {"url": "https://x.com/Dantinhas/", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/prova_anjo_9_twitter_dantinhas.md", "titulo": "Cobertura ao vivo @Dantinhas — 9ª Prova do Anjo"}
   ```

### GShow article accuracy

GShow articles can contain factual errors (e.g., omitting excluded participants, wrong scores). **Always cross-verify with multiple sources** (Twitter live coverage, broadcast screenshots, other fan accounts) before recording data. When a discrepancy is found, note it in the data (e.g., `"nota"` field in `provas.json`).

## Public vs Private Documentation Policy (Agents)

This repository is public. Agents must enforce a strict documentation boundary:

- Public docs: only approved pillar docs (see `docs/PUBLIC_PRIVATE_DOCS_POLICY.md`).
- Private docs/tooling: local-only and never pushed (`.private/**`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.claude/**`, `.worktrees/**`, WIP/review/planning docs).
- If visibility is unclear, default to private and place under `.private/docs/`.

Pre-push checklist:

1. Confirm current branch is intended for push: normally `main`, or `feature/*` only when intentionally opening a PR. Never push `local/*`.
2. Check staged files: `git diff --cached --name-only`.
3. Confirm no private-denylist paths are staged/tracked for push.
4. If needed, install/use `.githooks/pre-push` to block accidental exposure.

## Git Workflow (Main-First)

This repo now uses a **main-first workflow**. Day-to-day work happens on `main`. Private material stays local because it is ignored or explicitly blocked from public history.

| Branch | Purpose | Push? |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `main` | Normal working branch + public branch | Yes |
| `local/*` | Local-only archive/recovery branches | **NEVER** push |
| `feature/*` | Optional short-lived feature branches | Only when intentionally opening a PR |

Human commits on `main` use normal descriptive subjects. GitHub Actions bot commits on `main` still use the `data:` prefix.

The GitHub Actions bot polls every 15 minutes and auto-commits `data/` files when the API data changes (~5–15 snapshots/day). See [Triggering Site Updates](#triggering-site-updates).

### Daily Work (on `main`)

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin main

# After manual edits (the universal pattern)
python scripts/build_derived_data.py    # rebuild derived data (hard-fails on errors)
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "<description>"
git push origin main

# Optional immediate deploy (instead of waiting for next cron)
gh workflow run daily-update.yml
```

### Private Material

- Keep local-only notes and WIP docs under `.private/docs/` whenever possible.
- Never track private/denylist paths on `main` (`CLAUDE.md`, `.private/**`, `.claude/**`, `.worktrees/**`, `docs/superpowers/**`, and similar WIP docs).
- If a file is public-safe only in some cases, default to treating it as private until reviewed.

### Commit & Publish Workflow

All checklists end with "Rebuild + commit + publish". This is the standard procedure:

```bash
# 1. Rebuild derived data (validates schemas, hard-fails on errors)
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# 2. Stage and commit
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "<description>"

# 3. Push and optionally deploy immediately
git push origin main
gh workflow run daily-update.yml
```

If you are on `feature/*`, finish the feature-branch flow below first. If you are on `local/*`, stop and review whether the work belongs on `main` at all before pushing anything.

> **Pre-push hook**: `.githooks/pre-push` blocks pushes from `local/*` branches, tracked private paths, bad bot commit prefixes, and gitlinks.

### Handling Push Conflicts

Most conflicts come from bot-written generated files on `main` (`data/snapshots/*`, `data/latest.json`, `data/derived/*`, and `docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md`). Standard recovery flow when conflicts are limited to those files:

```bash
git pull --rebase origin main

# If conflicts are only in bot-written generated files, keep main's copy and rebuild
git checkout --ours data/snapshots/ data/latest.json data/derived/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md
git add data/snapshots/ data/latest.json data/derived/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md
git rebase --continue
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# Commit only if the rebuild produced a diff
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md
git commit -m "rebuild derived after rebase"

git push origin main
```

If `docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md` conflicts, do **not** blindly take either side. That file contains a bot-managed block inside a human-maintained doc. Resolve it manually or abort and let the next successful bot run regenerate the managed block.

Derived files are always regenerated — the source of truth is manual files + snapshots.

### Legacy `local/private-main` Recovery (optional)

If you still have a stale `local/private-main`, treat it as archival history, not as the normal working branch.

Useful inspection commands:

```bash
git cherry -v main local/private-main
git log --oneline --no-merges main..local/private-main
git stash list
```

`scripts/sync_public.sh` remains available as a **legacy reconciliation helper** for reviewed commits from `local/private-main`, but it is no longer the recommended daily workflow.

```bash
scripts/sync_public.sh
scripts/sync_public.sh --apply --report .private/docs/CONFLICT_REPORTS/<report>.md
```

Use it only when you are intentionally reconciling old local commits back onto `main`.

### Bot-managed vs Manual-managed files

Current `daily-update.yml` behavior:

- GitHub Actions bot updates:
  - `data/snapshots/*`
  - `data/latest.json`
  - `data/derived/*`
  - `docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md`
  - bot-managed block inside `docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md`
- Manual source files (not bot-written by current workflow):
  - `data/manual_events.json`
  - `data/paredoes.json`
  - `data/provas.json`
  - `data/votalhada/polls.json`

### Feature Branch → `main` (Multi-Commit Features)

For features developed on `feature/*` branches (multi-file refactors, new cards, new scripts):

```bash
# 1. Finish and test on feature branch
pytest tests/ -x -q
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# 2. Switch to main — pull latest (bot may have committed data)
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin main

# 3. Squash-apply ALL code changes from feature branch (exclude derived data)
#    Use --no-commit to stage without committing, then rebuild
git merge --squash feature/<name>

# 4. If merge conflicts are limited to bot-written generated files:
#    accept main's version for `data/snapshots/*`, `data/latest.json`,
#    `data/derived/*`, and `docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md`, then rebuild
git checkout --ours data/snapshots/ data/latest.json data/derived/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md
git add data/snapshots/ data/latest.json data/derived/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md

# 5. If `docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md` conflicts, resolve it manually or
#    abort and let the next successful bot run regenerate the managed block.
#
# 6. If merge conflicts in code files (e.g., index_data_builder.py):
#    Resolve MANUALLY — understand both sides before choosing
#    Main may have added features (saldo_card, link fixes) that your branch doesn't have
#    Never blindly take --ours or --theirs for code files

# 7. Rebuild derived data with main's latest snapshots + your code changes
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# 8. Run full test suite — fix any failures from integration
pytest tests/ -x -q

# 9. Stage everything and commit
git add -A
git commit -m "<description>"

# 10. Push and deploy
git push origin main
gh workflow run daily-update.yml

# 11. Clean up
git branch -d feature/<name>
```

**Key rules for feature branches**:
- Human commits on `feature/*` and `main` use normal descriptive subjects
- `sync_public.sh` is legacy only; it is not part of the normal feature-branch flow
- Always resolve `data/derived/*` conflicts by accepting main's version then rebuilding
- Never take `--ours` for code files without reading both sides — main may have changes your branch is missing
- Close any open PR before squash-merging locally (avoids duplicate merge)
- Pre-push hook allows `feature/*` branches but validates no private files are tracked

### Handling Extraordinary Events

Surprise disqualification, mid-week dynamic, or any unplanned event:

```bash
git checkout main
git pull --rebase origin main             # 1. Sync first
# Edit the relevant data files            # 2. Make your edits
python scripts/build_derived_data.py      # 3. Rebuild
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "<what happened>"
git push origin main
gh workflow run daily-update.yml          # 4. Deploy immediately
```

---

## Triggering Site Updates

The GitHub Pages site at `ferazambuja.github.io/BBB26/` updates through the `daily-update.yml` workflow. **Pushing to `main` does NOT trigger a render** — the workflow runs on cron and manual dispatch only.

### Three ways the site updates

| Method | When it runs | What happens |
|--------|-------------|--------------|
| **Auto (cron)** | Every 15 minutes | Fetches API → saves snapshot if data changed → builds + renders + deploys |
| **Manual dispatch** | On demand | Runs the full pipeline immediately (fetch + build + render + deploy) |
| **After push** | Never (automatic) | Push alone does **not** trigger a build — you must dispatch manually or wait for the next cron |

### Manual dispatch (most common for code/layout changes)

After pushing code, QMD, CSS, or manual data changes to `main`:

```bash
gh workflow run daily-update.yml
```

This triggers the full pipeline: fetch → pytest → build_derived_data → quarto render → deploy to Pages.

### Monitoring a run

```bash
gh run list --limit 5                  # find recent runs
gh run watch                           # live-follow the latest run
gh run view <run-id> --log             # full logs for a specific run
```

### When to dispatch manually

- After pushing **any** change to `main` (code, QMD, CSS, docs, manual data)
- After a failed run that you've fixed locally
- When you need the site updated faster than the 15-minute cron cycle

### When you DON'T need to dispatch

- After the bot auto-commits a new snapshot (the workflow already handles the full pipeline)
- If only `data/` changed via the bot's cron poll (build+deploy runs automatically when data changes)

## Weekly Calendar

### Standard Week Pattern (Líder Cycle)

Each BBB week follows a predictable pattern anchored to the Líder cycle.

> **Key rule**: The **Prova do Líder is the FIRST event of the new week**. Everything before it on the same day (e.g., afternoon Anjo prova) belongs to the PREVIOUS week. `WEEK_END_DATES` stores the last day of each week = the day BEFORE the Prova do Líder. When assigning `week` to events in `provas.json` or `manual_events.json`, use the **operational week** (which Líder presided), not `get_week_number(date)` — they can differ on Prova do Líder day.

Two recurring event types:
- **Sincerão** (Monday live show) — happens every week with a different format/theme
- **Week Dynamic** (Friday, varies) — the unique dynamic from the weekly dynamics article

| Dia | Horário (BRT) | Evento | Checklist to follow | Data files affected |
|-----|---------------|--------|---------------------|---------------------|

### Sincerão History (Monday — recurring weekly)

Data goes in `weekly_events[N].sincerao` (single `dict` or `list` of dicts for multiple rounds).

| Week | Date | Format | Notes |
|------|------|--------|-------|
| W1 | Mon Jan 19 | Pódio + quem não ganha | Plateia presente, Pipocômetro |
| W2 | Mon Jan 26 | Bombas com temas do público | Plateia define planta (Solange) |
| W3 | Mon Feb 2 | Pior futebol do mundo | Escalação com papéis negativos |
| W4 | Mon Feb 9 | Quem Sou Eu? (adivinhação) | Plateia define mais apagada (Marciele) |
| W5 | Mon Feb 16 | Cancelado (Carnaval) | Globo exibiu desfiles. Sincerão feito ao vivo de forma abreviada. Dados mínimos registrados (3 edges: previsões dos emparedados). |
| W6 | Fri Feb 20 + Mon Feb 23 | Paredão Perfeito + Régua de Prioridade | Two rounds (list format in JSON) |
| W7 | Mon Mar 2 | Linha Direta — maior traidor(a) | Each participant calls one person they consider the biggest traitor |
| W8 | Mon Mar 9 | Pódio dos Medrosos | 3 medalhas (covarde, frouxo/a, arregão/a). Cowboy mais visado (6×), Leandro zero |
| W9 | Mon Mar 16 | Quem faz alguém de bobo + quem está sendo feito de bobo | Placa dupla negativa. No agregado, Alberto Cowboy e Gabriela empataram como mais visados (7×); por placa, Alberto liderou “faz alguém de bobo” (7×) e Gabriela liderou “feito de bobo” (5×). |

### Week Dynamic History (Friday — varies each week)

Separate from Sincerão. Announced in the dynamics article (published ~Thursday).

| Week | Dynamic | Category |
|------|---------|----------|
| W1 | — (first week) | — |
| W2 | — | — |
| W3 | Big Fone (multiple) | `big_fone` |
| W4 | Sincerinho / Duelo de Risco | `special_events` |
| W5 | Bloco do Paredão (Máquina do Poder) | `special_events` |
| W6 | Sincerinho Paredão Perfeito + Big Fone + Duelo de Risco | `sincerao` + `special_events` |
| W7 | O Exilado + Paredão Falso + Quarto Secreto | `special_events` |
| W8 | Liderança Dupla + Consenso Anjo/Monstro + Contragolpe | `special_events` |
| W9 | TBD | TBD |

### Recurring Events Checklist (per week)

**Auto-scaffolding**: The timeline builder automatically generates placeholder events for recurring slots (Sincerão, Ganha-Ganha, Barrado no Baile, Presente do Anjo, Formação do Paredão, Eliminação). You do **not** need to add manual `scheduled_events` for these unless you want to override title/detail or time. Manual `scheduled_events` are now mainly for **week-specific dynamics** (e.g. Friday dynamic, Saturday shock, custom anjo/monstro placeholders).

When planning a new week, ensure:

- [ ] **Sincerão** (Monday) — scaffolded; add to `weekly_events[N].sincerao` when it happens (edges + stats)
- [ ] **Ganha-Ganha** (Tuesday) — scaffolded
- [ ] **Barrado no Baile** (Wednesday) — scaffolded; record in power_events when it happens
- [ ] **Prova do Líder** (Thursday) — see Líder Transition Checklist (provas.json)
- [ ] **Week Dynamic** (Friday) — **manual** `scheduled_events` or `special_events`; varies each week
- [ ] **Prova do Anjo** (Saturday) — API auto-detects; optional scheduled placeholder
- [ ] **Monstro** (Saturday) — API / weekly_events; optional scheduled placeholder
- [ ] **Presente do Anjo** (Sunday afternoon) — scaffolded
- [ ] **Paredão Formation** (Sunday ~22h45) — scaffolded; formation sub-steps from paredoes.json when complete
- [ ] **Eliminação** (Tuesday) — scaffolded

**Operational invariant**:
- Real events (from API, paredoes, weekly_events, power_events) and manual scheduled events take priority over scaffold placeholders.
- Use manual `scheduled_events` for week-specific dynamics and optional overrides (e.g. custom time or description).

**Scrape + map workflow (required before editing `scheduled_events`)**:
1. Scrape the dynamics article first (published Thursday):
   ```bash
   python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<dinamica-semana-url>" -o docs/scraped/
   ```
2. Start from the recurring weekly baseline template (below).
3. Build a day-by-day event list from the scraped file (`docs/scraped/*.md`) to identify **additional week-specific dynamics**.
4. Register all upcoming week events in one pass (`anjo`, `monstro`, `presente_anjo`, `sincerao`, `paredao_formacao`, `paredao_resultado`, `ganha_ganha`, `barrado_baile`, plus `dinamica` extras).
5. If Líder/VIP are still unknown, keep placeholders in descriptions (`a definir`) and update later from the Prova do Líder + VIP article workflow.
6. Always include both the original URL and scraped file path in `fontes`.

### Baseline weekly template (reference; most slots auto-scaffolded)

The timeline builder auto-generates scaffold events for the recurring slots below. You only need to add manual `scheduled_events` for **week-specific** items (e.g. Friday dynamic, extra dinâmicas). Reference for week `N`:

| Day | Category | Suggested title | Required detail hint |
|-----|----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| Saturday | `anjo` | Prova do Anjo | Standard Saturday prova |
| Saturday | `monstro` | Castigo do Monstro | Anjo escolhe o(s) alvo(s) do Monstro |
| Sunday (afternoon) | `presente_anjo` | Presente do Anjo | Anjo escolhe entre 2ª imunidade ou vídeo da família + almoço |
| Sunday (night) | `paredao_formacao` | Formação do Paredão | Keep Líder as `a definir` if unresolved |
| Monday | `sincerao` | Sincerão | Formato da semana a definir until confirmed |
| Tuesday | `paredao_resultado` | Eliminação | Resultado do paredão da semana |
| Tuesday | `ganha_ganha` | Ganha-Ganha | Veto + decisão (prêmio vs informação) |
| Wednesday | `barrado_baile` | Barrado no Baile | Líder vigente barra alguém da festa |

**Verification (required before commit)**:
Baseline recurring events (Sincerão, Ganha-Ganha, Barrado, Presente do Anjo, Formação do Paredão, Eliminação) are **auto-scaffolded** by the timeline builder — they do not need manual `scheduled_events` entries. To verify scaffolds appear correctly in the built timeline:
```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py
jq '[.[] | select(.source == "scaffold" and .week == 9)] | group_by(.category) | map({category: .[0].category, count: length})' data/derived/game_timeline.json
```

## Líder Transition Checklist (Thursday night)

> **The Prova do Líder is the first event of the new week.** All events before it on the same day belong to the previous week. This checklist marks the start of a new game week.

When a new Líder is crowned (typically Thursday ~22h BRT), follow these steps **in order**:

### Immediate (Thursday night / Friday morning)

1. **Scrape articles** — save `.md` copies for provenance (see [Agent: Web Scraping](#agent-web-scraping--source-collection) — **never use WebFetch on GShow URLs**):
   ```bash
   python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<prova-do-lider-url>" -o docs/scraped/
   python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<vip-xepa-url>" -o docs/scraped/
   python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<dinamica-semana-url>" -o docs/scraped/  # if available
   ```

   **If the official Prova/VIP article is not out yet (live operation window):**
   - Create a provisional markdown record in `docs/scraped/` with timestamp + all known facts from the live feed/operation log.
   - Reference this provisional file in `provas.json.fontes`.
   - Use `vip_source: "api_fallback"` until the official VIP source is published.
   - Once official source arrives, replace/append sources and switch to `vip_source: "oficial_gshow"` if confirmed.

   **VIP article sourcing**: The VIP composition article is typically published within hours of the Prova do Líder result. Search the Líder's GShow profile page or the Cartola BBB section for the VIP/Xepa article. Add to `fontes` in both `paredoes.json` and `provas.json`.
   - **Required field in `provas.json` (tipo=`lider`)**: add `vip` (array with point-eligible VIP names for the round) and `vip_source`.
   - `vip_source` values:
     - `oficial_gshow` when list is confirmed by article.
     - `api_fallback` only when no reliable article/list is available yet.
     - Temporary exception: if official VIP is known but Cartola strict validation is failing due stale API extras, keep `api_fallback` until API syncs, keep official URLs in `fontes`, then switch to `oficial_gshow`.
   - Cartola safeguard uses `provas.lider.vip` as primary source and API as fallback. Unexpected extra names from API in strict weeks fail the build.

2. **Update `data/provas.json`** — add Prova do Líder results (phases, scores, placements).
   Include `fontes` with `{url, arquivo, titulo}` format pointing to scraped files.
   See templates below (standard and resistance prova formats).

   **Cronologia guardrail (required)**:
   - `cronologia` now has a Líder fallback sourced from `provas.json` (`tipo=lider`) when API role sync is delayed.
   - Minimum required fields for fallback: `tipo`, `date`, and `vencedor` (or `vencedores`).
   - After updating `provas.json`, rebuild and confirm a `lider` event exists in `data/derived/game_timeline.json` even if API is lagging.

   **Phase-by-phase live updates are allowed**:
   - If only phase 1 is known, save phase 1 immediately with a provisional `nota`.
   - Append/update phase 2 as soon as it finishes (same prova entry).
   - Keep provenance explicit for each update (provisional + official when available).

   **Resistance/dupla provas — full elimination order**:
   - For resistance or elimination-format provas, record **ALL participants** in order of exit (last out = pos 1)
   - For dupla provas, both members share the same position
   - `participantes_total` = number who actually competed (total active minus excluded)
   - `excluidos: []` required even if empty
   - Reference: Prova #1 (26h resistance, 20 participants fully ranked) is the model
   - Source: GShow publishes individual "Nª dupla a deixar a prova" articles — scrape each for provenance

   **Why complete rankings matter**: Every `classificacao` position feeds into `prova_rankings.json` scoring. Unranked participants receive 0 points. Record ALL positions — not just the winner. For multi-phase provas, include both phase results so the builder can compute final positions with offsets. See [How to extract positions from articles](#how-to-extract-positions-from-articles) in the Anjo checklist for a step-by-step guide on turning article text into `classificacao` entries.

   **Scoring reference** (hardcoded in `scripts/builders/provas.py`):

   | Position | Base Points | × Líder (1.5) | × Anjo (1.0) | × Bate e Volta (0.75) |
   |----------|------------|---------------|--------------|----------------------|
   | 1st      | 10         | 15.0          | 10.0         | 7.5                  |
   | 2nd      | 7          | 10.5          | 7.0          | 5.25                 |
   | 3rd      | 5          | 7.5           | 5.0          | 3.75                 |
   | 4th      | 4          | 6.0           | 4.0          | 3.0                  |
   | 5th      | 3          | 4.5           | 3.0          | 2.25                 |
   | 6th      | 2          | 3.0           | 2.0          | 1.5                  |
   | 7th-8th  | 1          | 1.5           | 1.0          | 0.75                 |
   | 9th+     | 0.5        | 0.75          | 0.5          | 0.375                |
   | DQ       | 0          | 0             | 0            | 0                    |

   **`participantes_total` validation**: Must equal the number of active participants who competed (house count minus `excluidos`). Cross-check against the participant count for the current week.

   **Líder prova template** (add to `provas` array):
   ```json
   {
     "numero": N,
     "tipo": "lider",
     "week": W,
     "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "nome": "Nª Prova do Líder — Description",
     "formato": "format_type",
     "vencedor": "Winner Name",
     "vip": ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3", "Name4"],
     "vip_source": "oficial_gshow",
     "participantes_total": 14,
     "excluidos": [],
     "nota": "Brief description of how the prova worked and who won.",
     "fases": [
       {"fase": 1, "tipo": "...", "classificacao": [{"pos": 1, "nome": "Winner"}, ...]}
     ],
     "fontes": [{"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "..."}]
   }
   ```

   **Resistance prova template** (full elimination order):
   ```json
   {
     "numero": N,
     "tipo": "lider",
     "week": W,
     "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "nome": "Nª Prova do Líder — Resistência em Duplas",
     "formato": "resistencia_duplas",
     "vencedor": "Winner Name",
     "vencedores": ["Winner1", "Winner2"],
     "vip": ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3"],
     "vip_source": "oficial_gshow",
     "participantes_total": 14,
     "excluidos": [],
     "nota": "Description of the resistance prova.",
     "fases": [
       {
         "fase": 1,
         "tipo": "resistencia_duplas",
         "classificacao": [
           {"pos": 1, "nome": "Winner1", "nota": "Última dupla (7ª)"},
           {"pos": 1, "nome": "Winner2", "nota": "Última dupla (7ª)"},
           {"pos": 3, "nome": "Name3", "nota": "6ª dupla a sair"},
           {"pos": 3, "nome": "Name4", "nota": "6ª dupla a sair"},
           {"pos": 13, "nome": "NameN", "nota": "1ª dupla a sair"}
         ]
       }
     ],
     "fontes": [{"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "..."}]
   }
   ```

3. **Create paredão skeleton in `data/paredoes.json`** — even before formation details.
   This is **critical** for `leader_periods` to show the correct Líder for the week.
   ```json
   {
     "numero": N,
     "status": "em_andamento",
     "data": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "data_formacao": "YYYY-MM-DD",
     "titulo": "Nº Paredão — DD de Mês de YYYY",
     "semana": N,
     "total_esperado": 3,
     "formacao": {"lider": "Líder Name", "lideres": ["Líder Name"]},
     "indicados_finais": [],
     "fontes": [{"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "..."}]
   }
   ```
   **Note**: `formacao.lider` (nested under `formacao`), NOT top-level `lider`.

   **Dual Leadership**: When two Líderes share power (e.g., Week 8 "Liderança em Dobro"):
   ```json
   "formacao": {"lider": "Name A + Name B", "lideres": ["Name A", "Name B"]}
   ```
   - `lider` — display string (joined with ` + `)
   - `lideres` — array of individual names (used for iteration in scoring, Cartola, prediction)
   - The pipeline auto-handles: Cartola points for both, VIP edges from both, prediction per Líder

4. **Update `data/manual_events.json`** — add scheduled events for the new week using the [Recurring Events Checklist](#recurring-events-checklist-per-week). Record power events (Big Fone, etc.) if any.

5. **Rebuild + commit + publish** — follow [Commit & Publish Workflow](#commit--publish-workflow):
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_derived_data.py
   git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
   git commit -m "week N Líder transition (Name)"
   # Then push origin/main and trigger deploy if needed — see Commit & Publish Workflow
   ```

### API auto-detects (no manual action needed)

These are picked up automatically by `build_daily_roles()` from snapshots:
- **Líder role** — appears in `characteristics.roles` (usually within hours of the ceremony)
- **VIP/Xepa groups** — appears in `characteristics.group` (fallback/audit source; official VIP scoring source is `provas.lider.vip`)
- **Roles cleared briefly** during transition (roles empty for a few hours → normal)

### Later (when Líder term ends)

6. **Week boundary handling (confirmed + inferred)**:
   - `scripts/data_utils.py` now computes **effective** boundaries:
     - confirmed boundaries from static `WEEK_END_DATES`
     - inferred boundary for an open week when week `N+1` already has dated signals in data (e.g., `scheduled_events`, `provas`, `paredoes`, `power_events`).
   - This avoids getting "stuck" in the old week when the next cycle is already dated in operations data, even if a new Líder is not fully confirmed yet.
   - Practical rule: the week should naturally roll once next-week entries are dated; no emergency hardcode is needed for day-to-day ops.

7. **Still keep `WEEK_END_DATES` curated for history**:
   - After the next Líder cycle is confirmed, append the final boundary date to static `WEEK_END_DATES` as archival truth.
   - Example: if week 8 effectively closed on `2026-03-13` from next-week signals, later confirm and persist that boundary in `WEEK_END_DATES`.

### Verification

After rebuilding, verify:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('data/derived/index_data.json') as f:
    idx = json.load(f)
for lp in idx['leader_periods']:
    print(f'Week {lp[\"week\"]}: {lp[\"leader\"]} | VIP={lp[\"vip\"][:3]}...')
"
```

Check that the new week shows the correct Líder (not `null`) and VIP composition.

Additional week-boundary sanity check:
```bash
python - <<'PY'
import sys
sys.path.append('scripts')
from data_utils import get_week_number
for d in ["2026-03-13", "2026-03-14", "2026-03-17"]:
    print(d, "-> week", get_week_number(d))
PY
```
Expected behavior: dates after the inferred boundary roll to the next week (no stale week lock).

## Anjo / Monstro Update Checklist (Saturday)

When the Prova do Anjo results are published (typically Saturday afternoon article + Saturday night Monstro choice):

### 1. Scrape article(s) + collect source images

> **Do NOT use WebFetch or AI web tools for GShow URLs** — they will fail. See [Agent: Web Scraping & Source Collection](#agent-web-scraping--source-collection).

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<prova-do-anjo-url>" -o docs/scraped/
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<castigo-do-monstro-url>" -o docs/scraped/  # if separate article
```

If broadcast screenshots or Twitter screenshots are available (e.g., duel scores, bracket results), move them from repo root to `docs/scraped/` with descriptive names and create a Twitter archive `.md` file. See [Source images](#source-images-broadcast-screenshots-twitterx).

### 2. Update `data/provas.json`

Add a new entry to the `provas` array:

```json
{
  "numero": N,
  "tipo": "anjo",
  "week": W,
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "nome": "Nª Prova do Anjo — Description",
  "formato": "format_type",
  "vencedor": "Winner Name",
  "participantes_total": 12,
  "excluidos": [{"nome": "Name", "motivo": "reason"}],
  "nota": "Brief description of how the prova worked.",
  "fases": [
    {"fase": 1, "tipo": "...", "classificacao": [{"pos": 1, "nome": "..."}, ...]},
    {"fase": 2, "tipo": "...", "classificacao": [{"pos": 1, "nome": "Winner"}]}
  ],
  "fontes": [{"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "..."}]
}
```

**Phase rules**: Each phase has its own `classificacao`. For binary-outcome finals (e.g., "correct box"), use **winner only** (no rankings for losers). For timed/scored phases, include all participants with positions.

**`nota_ranking`**: When the source only reveals finalists, classificados, or the winner, add a short `nota_ranking` explaining exactly what is missing. This marks the prova as intentionally partial, keeps the limitation explicit in the data, and suppresses the generic completeness warning during `build_derived_data.py`.

**Scoring**: Every position feeds into `prova_rankings.json`. Record ALL placements, not just the winner. The build will **warn** if `participantes_total` doesn't match the number of ranked participants, and **hard-fail** if the winner isn't at position 1. See scoring table in [Líder Checklist](#líder-transition-checklist-thursday-night).

**`participantes_total` validation**: Must equal the number of active participants who competed (house count minus `excluidos`). Cross-check against the participant count for the current week.

**Excluded**: Líder always excluded (doesn't play). For dual leadership weeks, **both Líderes** are excluded (reduces field by 2). Others excluded by sorteio, punishment, etc.

#### How to extract positions from articles

Articles rarely give clean rankings. Follow this process to turn article text into `classificacao` entries:

**Step 1 — Count participants.** Active house count minus `excluidos` = `participantes_total`. All of them must appear in at least one phase's `classificacao`.

**Step 2 — Identify what the article tells you.** Typical patterns:
- Names of eliminated participants per round
- Names of finalists
- Winner

**Step 3 — Deduce missing positions.** If the article names 6 eliminated in round 1 and 3 finalists, the remaining participants (total minus eliminated minus finalists) were eliminated in intermediate rounds. Use tied positions for them.

**Step 4 — Choose phase structure.** Use the minimum number of phases that captures all known data:

| Article gives you | Use this structure |
|---|---|
| Full per-round results | One fase per round, each with complete classificacao |
| Eliminatória results + final winner only | 2 fases: (1) eliminatória pass/fail, (2) winner-only final |
| Eliminatória + finalists but not intermediate rounds | 2 fases: (1) eliminatória, (2) classificatória with finalists ranked + intermediates tied |
| Only the winner | 1 fase with winner at pos 1 (other participants get `null` — no ranking points) |

**Step 5 — Assign positions.** Rules:
- **Survivors of a pass/fail phase**: all share `pos: 1` (they all "won" that phase)
- **Eliminated together**: all share the same position (e.g., 6 eliminated share `pos: 7` if 6 advanced)
- **Unknown ordering within a group**: use `"tied": true` on each entry
- **Phase offsets (2-phase provas)**: the builder auto-adds `n_phase2` to phase 1 positions, so phase 1 eliminated at `pos: 7` become final position `7 + 6 = 13` (if phase 2 has 6 entries)

**Example** — 12 participants, article says "6 eliminated in round 1; finalists were Milena, Samira, Leandro; Milena won":
```json
{"fase": 1, "tipo": "eliminatoria", "classificacao": [
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Milena", "nota": "Avançou"},
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Samira", "nota": "Avançou"},
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Leandro", "nota": "Avançou"},
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Ana Paula Renault", "nota": "Avançou"},
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Babu Santana", "nota": "Avançou"},
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Solange Couto", "nota": "Avançou"},
  {"pos": 7, "nome": "Breno", "nota": "Eliminado na eliminatória"},
  {"pos": 7, "nome": "Chaiany", "nota": "Eliminada na eliminatória"},
  {"pos": 7, "nome": "Gabriela", "nota": "Eliminada na eliminatória"},
  {"pos": 7, "nome": "Jordana", "nota": "Eliminada na eliminatória"},
  {"pos": 7, "nome": "Juliano Floss", "nota": "Eliminado na eliminatória"},
  {"pos": 7, "nome": "Marciele", "nota": "Eliminada na eliminatória"}
]},
{"fase": 2, "tipo": "classificatoria", "classificacao": [
  {"pos": 1, "nome": "Milena"},
  {"pos": 2, "nome": "Samira", "nota": "Finalista", "tied": true},
  {"pos": 2, "nome": "Leandro", "nota": "Finalista", "tied": true},
  {"pos": 4, "nome": "Ana Paula Renault", "nota": "Eliminada na classificatória", "tied": true},
  {"pos": 4, "nome": "Babu Santana", "nota": "Eliminado na classificatória", "tied": true},
  {"pos": 4, "nome": "Solange Couto", "nota": "Eliminada na classificatória", "tied": true}
]}
```

This produces final rankings: Milena 1st (10pts), Samira/Leandro tied 2nd (7pts each), Ana Paula/Babu/Solange tied 4th (4pts each), 6 eliminated share 13th (0.5pts each via offset: pos 7 + 6 phase2 entries).

### 3. Update `data/manual_events.json` → `weekly_events[N].anjo`

Create or update the week's `weekly_events` entry with the `anjo` object:

```json
{
  "anjo": {
    "vencedor": "Winner Name",
    "prova_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "almoco_date": null,
    "almoco_convidados": [],
    "escolha": null,
    "usou_extra_poder": null,
    "imunizado": null,
    "monstro": "Monstro Name",
    "monstro_tipo": "Monstro Description",
    "monstro_motivo": "Why the Anjo chose this person + consequences",
    "notas": "Brief summary of what happened.",
    "fontes": ["<article-url>"]
  }
}
```

**Fill-later fields** (Sunday [Presente do Anjo](#presente-do-anjo-checklist-sunday-afternoon)): `almoco_date`, `almoco_convidados`, `escolha`, `usou_extra_poder`, `imunizado`. Fill after the Sunday afternoon show.

**Monstro**: API auto-detects the role. Fill `monstro` name from article or API.
- `monstro_tipo`: descriptive name of the castigo (e.g., "Monstro Movendo Areia", "Castigo do Monstro — Fantasia de abóbora")
- `monstro_motivo`: Anjo's stated reason + consequences (e.g., loss of estalecas, VIP→Xepa)
- Note: GShow sometimes publishes a separate "Castigo do Monstro" article — scrape it if available and add to `fontes`

**Cartola `monstro_retirado_vip`**: Auto-detected. If the Monstro recipient was in VIP in the previous snapshot, the -5 penalty is automatically applied. No manual entry needed.

### 4. Update scheduled events (do NOT delete)

**Update** the `scheduled_events` for this date's `anjo` and `monstro` entries with the real results (winner name, castigo details). **Do NOT remove them.**

Why: Anjo timeline events have a `provas.json` fallback (like Líder), and Monstro has a `weekly_events.anjo.monstro` fallback. These create real timeline entries immediately after updating `provas.json` and `manual_events.json` — no need to wait for the API. However, deleting the scheduled events prematurely removes the safety net if the fallback fails for any reason.

**What to do**:
- Update `title` to include the result (e.g., `"Prova do Anjo — Breno vence"`)
- Update `detail` with what happened
- Update `fontes` with the scraped article URL
- Keep the entries in `scheduled_events` — auto-dedup will suppress them once the API captures the new roles. The `time` field is ignored for past events (automatic lifecycle), so removing it is optional

**When to clean up**: Remove past scheduled events during the **next week's setup** (Líder Transition Checklist), not on the same day they happen. By then, the API will have captured the roles and the auto-dedup makes the scheduled entries invisible anyway.

### 5. Rebuild + commit + publish

Follow [Commit & Publish Workflow](#commit--publish-workflow):
```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "Nª Prova do Anjo (Winner) + Monstro (Name)"
# Then push origin/main and trigger deploy if needed — see Commit & Publish Workflow
```

### Timeline fallback system (how Cronologia stays complete)

The Cronologia do Jogo timeline has **multiple sources per event type**. When the API hasn't captured a snapshot yet, fallbacks from manual data ensure the timeline is never missing entries:

| Category | Primary source | Fallback source | When fallback kicks in |
|----------|---------------|-----------------|----------------------|
| **Líder** | API auto-detection | `provas.json` (tipo=lider) | API hasn't captured role change yet |
| **Anjo** | API auto-detection | `provas.json` (tipo=anjo) | API hasn't captured role change yet |
| **Monstro** | API auto-detection | `weekly_events.anjo.monstro` | API hasn't captured role change yet |
| **Imune** | API auto-detection | `paredoes.json` (formacao.imunizado) | Covered by `paredao_imunidade` ceremony step |
| **Sincerão** | `weekly_events.sincerao` | — | Manual-only (fill after Monday show) |
| **Ganha-Ganha** | `weekly_events.ganha_ganha` | — | Manual-only (fill after Tuesday show) |
| **Barrado** | `power_events` (barrado_baile) | — | Manual-only (fill after Wednesday) |
| **Presente Anjo** | `weekly_events.anjo.escolha` | — | Manual-only (fill after Sunday almoço) |
| **Paredão formation** | `paredoes.json` (indicados_finais) | — | Ceremony sub-steps auto-generated |
| **Paredão resultado** | `paredoes.json` (resultado) | — | Fill after elimination |

**Key**: Once you update `provas.json` and `manual_events.json`, rebuild creates real timeline events immediately — no need to wait for the API. The scheduled_events (if any) are auto-deduped by `(date, category)`.

### API auto-detects (no manual action needed)

- **Anjo role** — `characteristics.roles` contains `"Anjo"`
- **Monstro role** — `characteristics.roles` contains `"Monstro"`
- Both appear in `auto_events.json` and `roles_daily.json` after rebuild
- **Timeline fallback**: If the API hasn't detected the role yet, `provas.json` (Anjo) and `weekly_events.anjo.monstro` (Monstro) create real timeline entries automatically

### Note on Cartola articles

GShow publishes Cartola-specific recap articles for Líder, Anjo, VIP, Monstro, etc. (e.g., "Alberto Cowboy soma pontos no Cartola BBB"). These are **informational/provenance only** — all Cartola points are auto-detected by `build_derived_data.py`. Optionally scrape and add to `fontes` in `provas.json` or `paredoes.json` for traceability.

## Presente do Anjo Checklist (Sunday afternoon)

The Presente do Anjo happens Sunday afternoon (~14h-17h BRT). The Anjo invites 2-3 guests for an Almoço do Anjo and makes a choice: watch a family video OR gain a 2nd immunity to give at formation.

**Key fact**: As of W7, every Anjo has chosen `video_familia` (no one has ever used the 2nd immunity).

### 1. Scrape the Presente do Anjo article

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<presente-do-anjo-url>" -o docs/scraped/
```

### 2. Update `data/manual_events.json` → `weekly_events[N].anjo`

Fill the fields that were left `null` on Saturday:

```json
{
  "almoco_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "almoco_convidados": ["Guest1", "Guest2", "Guest3"],
  "escolha": "video_familia",
  "usou_extra_poder": false,
  "imunizado": null
}
```

**Field reference**:

| Field | Values | When to fill |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `almoco_date` | `"YYYY-MM-DD"` | Sunday — date of the almoço |
| `almoco_convidados` | `["Name1", "Name2"]` | Sunday — who the Anjo invited |
| `escolha` | `"video_familia"` or `"imunidade_extra"` | Sunday — what the Anjo chose |
| `usou_extra_poder` | `false` (chose video) or `true` (chose immunity) | Sunday — always matches `escolha` |
| `imunizado` | `"Name"` or `null` | Sunday night (Paredão formation) — who the Anjo immunized |

**Scoring impact**: Each `almoco_convidados` guest gets a `+0.15` positive `almoco_anjo` edge from the Anjo in the relations scoring. These edges appear in `relations_scores.json`.

**Timeline**: A `presente_anjo` (🎁) event is automatically generated in the game timeline from this data. No manual timeline entry needed.

### 3. Update `data/paredoes.json` → `formacao.anjo_escolha`

Add the `anjo_escolha` descriptive field to the current paredão's `formacao`:

```json
{
  "formacao": {
    "anjo": "Anjo Name",
    "anjo_escolha": "Abriu mão da 2ª imunidade para ver vídeo da família com Guest1, Guest2 e Guest3"
  }
}
```

### 4. Add article to `fontes`

Add the scraped article URL to the anjo's `fontes` array in `weekly_events[N].anjo.fontes`.

### 5. Rebuild + commit + publish

Follow [Commit & Publish Workflow](#commit--publish-workflow):
```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "Presente do Anjo W{N} (Name chose video/immunity)"
# Then push origin/main and trigger deploy if needed — see Commit & Publish Workflow
```

### Presente do Anjo History

| Week | Anjo | Escolha | Convidados | Imunizou |
|------|------|---------|------------|----------|
| W1 | Jonas Sulzbach | video_familia | Alberto Cowboy, Aline Campos, Sarah Andrade | Sarah Andrade |
| W2 | Jonas Sulzbach | video_familia | Sarah Andrade, Maxiane, Marciele | — (autoimune) |
| W3 | Sarah Andrade | video_familia | Jonas Sulzbach, Sol Vega, Brigido | Sol Vega |
| W4 | Alberto Cowboy | video_familia | Jonas Sulzbach, Sarah Andrade, Edilson | Edilson |
| W5 | Gabriela | video_familia | Chaiany, Jordana | Chaiany |
| W6 | Chaiany | video_familia | Gabriela, Babu Santana, Solange Couto | Gabriela |
| W7 | Alberto Cowboy | video_familia | Gabriela, Jordana, Marciele | Jonas Sulzbach |
| W8 | Milena | video_familia | Ana Paula Renault, Juliano Floss, Samira | Ana Paula Renault |
| W9 | Breno | *(pending Sunday)* | *(pending)* | *(pending)* |

**Pattern**: 8/8 Anjos chose family video. The 2nd immunity has never been used.

## Paredão Formation Checklist (Sunday)

When the Paredão formation airs (Sunday ~22h45 BRT live show):

**Split-formation paredões**: Some weeks split the formation across two live shows (e.g., Saturday dynamic + Sunday completion). In that case:
- **Saturday**: Scrape the dynamic article, fill `paredoes.json` with partial data (group structure, initial nominees in `indicados_finais` with `"como": "Dinâmica (...)"`), add fonte, update the Saturday dynamic's scheduled event in `manual_events.json → scheduled_events` with the real result (step 4b), rebuild, commit.
- **Sunday**: Complete the formation (Máquina do Poder, Líder indication, house votes, contragolpe, Bate e Volta). Update `indicados_finais` to reflect the final state, add power events to `manual_events.json`, scrape the Sunday article, rebuild, commit.
- Steps 1–5 below apply to the **Sunday completion**. For the Saturday step, do steps 1, 2 (partial), 4b, and 5.

### 1. Scrape the formation article

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<formacao-paredao-url>" -o docs/scraped/
```

### 2. Update `data/paredoes.json` (existing skeleton or new entry)

Fill in the formation details. **Key fields** (nested under `formacao`):

```json
{
  "numero": N,
  "status": "em_andamento",
  "data": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "data_formacao": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "titulo": "Nº Paredão — DD de Mês de YYYY",
  "semana": N,
  "total_esperado": 3,
  "formacao": {
    "resumo": "Description of how the paredão was formed",
    "lider": "Líder Name",
    "indicado_lider": "Who the Líder nominated",
    "motivo_indicacao": "Why the Líder chose this person",
    "anjo": "Anjo Name",
    "anjo_escolha": "Abriu mão da 2ª imunidade para ver vídeo da família",
    "imunizado": {"por": "Who gave immunity", "quem": "Who received"}
  },
  "indicados_finais": [
    {"nome": "Name", "grupo": "Pipoca", "como": "Líder"},
    {"nome": "Name", "grupo": "Camarote", "como": "Mais votado"},
    {"nome": "Name", "grupo": "Pipoca", "como": "Contragolpe"}
  ],
  "votos_casa": {"Voter1": "Target1", "Voter2": "Target2"},
  "fontes": [{"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "..."}]
}
```

**Critical**: Use `indicados_finais` (NOT `participantes`). Field `formacao.lider` (nested), NOT top-level `lider`.

### 3. Update `data/manual_events.json`

Add power events for the formation:
- `indicacao` (Líder → nominee)
- `contragolpe` (if applicable)
- `imunidade` (Anjo → imunizado)
- `bate_volta` (winners who escaped)

Also update `weekly_events[N].anjo.imunizado` with who the Anjo immunized at formation. The `escolha` and other Presente do Anjo fields should already be filled from the [Presente do Anjo Checklist](#presente-do-anjo-checklist-sunday-afternoon) (Sunday afternoon).

**Dual Líderes consensus**: When dual Líderes indicate in consensus, record as a single `indicacao` power_event with `"actor": "Name1 + Name2"` (display string) and `"actors": ["Name1", "Name2"]` (array for edge creation). Fill `formacao.indicado_lider` as normal. This produces 1 timeline row + 2 correct relationship edges.

**Consenso Anjo + Monstro**: When the week's dynamic requires Anjo and Monstro to consensus-nominate:
- If consensus reached: add a `power_event` with `"type": "consenso_anjo_monstro"`, `"actor": "Anjo + Monstro"`, `"actors": ["Anjo Name", "Monstro Name"]`, `"target": "Nominee"`. Add to `indicados_finais` with `"como": "Consenso Anjo+Monstro"`.
- If no consensus: both Anjo and Monstro go to paredão. Add each to `indicados_finais` with `"como": "Consenso falhou"`. No `power_event` needed.

**Two immunity fields** (both must be filled at formation):
- `weekly_events[N].anjo.imunizado` = simple string name (used for scoring edges)
- `paredoes[N].formacao.imunizado` = object `{"por": "Anjo Name", "quem": "Immunized Name"}` (used for display)

### 4. Update `data/provas.json` (if Bate e Volta happened)

Add a Bate e Volta prova entry with the results.

### 4b. Update scheduled events in Cronologia

If `data/manual_events.json → scheduled_events` has entries for events that just happened (e.g., a `dinamica` for the week's dynamic, `monstro` for the Castigo), update them with the real result:
- Replace the placeholder `title` and `detail` with what actually happened
- Add the formation article URL to `fontes`
- The `time` field can stay — the timeline builder automatically treats past-date events as real (see [Scheduled Events → Automatic lifecycle](#scheduled-events-upcoming-week))

The `paredao_formacao` sub-step is auto-generated from `paredoes.json`, but custom dynamics and other scheduled events must be manually updated.

### 5. Rebuild + commit + publish

Follow [Commit & Publish Workflow](#commit--publish-workflow):
```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "Nº Paredão formation"
# Then push origin/main and trigger deploy if needed — see Commit & Publish Workflow
```

### Auto-generated Ceremony Sub-Steps in Cronologia

When `build_derived_data.py` runs, the timeline builder reads `paredoes.json` and **automatically generates** up to 6 ordered sub-step events for each paredão formation date. No manual timeline entries are needed — just fill `paredoes.json` correctly.

**Standard ceremony flow** (Sunday ~22h45 live show):

| Order | Category | Emoji | What happens | Data source in `paredoes.json` |
|-------|----------|-------|--------------|-------------------------------|
| 1 | `paredao_imunidade` | 🛡️ | Anjo gives immunity (or self-immunizes) | `formacao.imunizado` or `formacao.autoimune` |
| 2 | `paredao_indicacao` | 🎯 | Líder nominates a participant | `formacao.indicado_lider` + `formacao.lider` |
| 3 | `paredao_votacao` | 🗳️ | House votes; most-voted announced | `votos_casa` (vote counts computed) |
| 4 | `paredao_contragolpe` | ⚔️ | Indicado do Líder counter-attacks | `formacao.contragolpe.de` + `.para` |
| 5 | `paredao_bate_volta` | 🔄 | 3 play; indicado do Líder never plays; winner escapes | `formacao.bate_volta` |
| 6 | `paredao_formacao` | 🔥 | Final nominees announced | `indicados_finais` |

**Notes**:
- Steps are only generated when the corresponding data exists (e.g., no `paredao_contragolpe` if `formacao.contragolpe` is empty).
- When a paredão sub-step covers the same event as a `power_event` entry, the redundant power_event is auto-suppressed (dedup by date + mapped category).
- Self-immunity (`formacao.autoimune: true`) shows "se autoimunizou" instead of the normal "X imunizou Y".
- Paredão Falso entries show "Paredão Falso" in the title instead of "Paredão".
- All previous paredões are backfilled automatically from existing data.

**Scheduling future paredão ceremony**: Add a single `paredao_formacao` scheduled event for Sunday (the summary step). The ceremony sub-steps will be auto-generated once the real formation data is entered — no need to schedule each sub-step.

## Votalhada Collection Checklist (Tuesday)

Before each elimination (~21h BRT), collect poll data from [Votalhada](https://votalhada.blogspot.com/).

Votalhada updates images roughly at: Mon 01:00, 08:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00 BRT; Tue 08:00, 12:00, 15:00, 18:00, 21:00 BRT.

**OCR layout note (updated March 16, 2026):**
- Votalhada switched to a new card layout on March 10: `VOTO DA TORCIDA`, `VOTO ÚNICO (CPF)`, `ANÁLISE VOTALHADA` sections
- The OCR parser was updated on March 16 to handle the new layout (platform extraction works; series/time have known limitations)
- For operational updates: OCR gate works for platform data; use **vision/manual extraction** as fallback for series and capture time if OCR misses them
- Recompute the consolidado with the **previous** Votalhada formula: weighted average by platform vote count
- Full status: `.private/docs/VOTALHADA_OCR_STATUS.md`

**Current ops policy**: use manual fetches/updates. The default production flow is:

1. `fetch_votalhada_images.py`
2. `votalhada_auto_update.py --dry-run`
3. `votalhada_auto_update.py --apply --build`

The local scheduler is disabled by default for live ops right now.

If a local scheduler is already running, stop it before continuing:

```bash
pkill -f schedule_votalhada_fetch.py
pkill -f "tail -f logs/votalhada_scheduler.log"
```

**Vote-window baseline (for trend projections):**
- Voting usually opens on Sunday/Monday after the live show.
- Voting usually closes around **Tuesday 22:45 BRT** (official result shortly after).
- Near finals, this close window can shift. In those weeks, set an explicit close override in `data/votalhada/polls.json` for that paredão:
  - `fechamento_votacao` (ISO, with timezone), e.g. `"2026-04-14T23:15:00-03:00"`.
  - If missing, dashboards assume Tuesday 22:45 BRT by default.

### 1. Fetch poll images with the script

```bash
# By paredão number (auto-derives URL from paredoes.json or current month)
python scripts/fetch_votalhada_images.py --paredao N

# Or by direct URL
python scripts/fetch_votalhada_images.py --url "https://votalhada.blogspot.com/YYYY/MM/pesquisaN.html"

# Optional: save platform-card audit JSON + fail on anomalies
python scripts/fetch_votalhada_images.py --paredao N \
  --platform-audit-output tmp/votalhada_ocr/platform_consistency_latest.json \
  --platform-audit-strict
```

**URL pattern**: Votalhada always uses `https://votalhada.blogspot.com/{year}/{month}/pesquisa{N}.html`. The script derives this automatically from `paredoes.json` when the skeleton exists. If no skeleton exists yet (e.g., new paredão not created), the script falls back to the **current BRT month/year** — so `--paredao 8` works immediately without needing a `paredoes.json` entry.

Quick URL generation for any paredão:

```bash
# Generate the Votalhada URL for paredão N (replace N with the number)
N=8; echo "https://votalhada.blogspot.com/$(date -u -d '-3 hours' +%Y/%m)/pesquisa${N}.html"

# macOS (BSD date)
N=8; echo "https://votalhada.blogspot.com/$(TZ=America/Sao_Paulo date +%Y/%m)/pesquisa${N}.html"
```

Images are saved to `data/votalhada/YYYY_MM_DD/` with a datetime suffix by default (e.g., `consolidados_2026-03-02_21-05.png`), preserving a history of captures for OCR training/regression work. Prefer keeping that history; do not use `--no-timestamp` unless you explicitly want overwrite mode.

**Run multiple times** (e.g., 01:00 and 21:00 BRT) to capture poll evolution.

After each fetch, the script automatically runs a **platform-card consistency audit** (Sites/YouTube/Twitter/Instagram):
- checks displayed `Média` row sums (PT-BR decimals with comma) and flags source-side drifts like YouTube `100,37`
- reports `ok` / `anomaly` / `inconclusive` per platform card
- use `--skip-platform-audit` to disable if needed

Standalone audit command (same logic):

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_platform_consistency_audit.py \
  --images-dir data/votalhada/YYYY_MM_DD \
  --output tmp/votalhada_ocr/platform_consistency_latest.json
```

### 2. Run latest-capture OCR gate (recommended when layout is stable)

Preferred validate-only command:

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_auto_update.py \
  --paredao N \
  --images-dir data/votalhada/YYYY_MM_DD \
  --dry-run \
  --output tmp/votalhada_ocr/paredao_N_latest.json
```

This is the production gate:
- auto-selects the best consolidado card by content
- validates only the **latest timestamped capture set** in the folder
- keeps older images available for OCR training instead of treating them as release blockers
- blocks apply if the parsed capture is not newer than `polls.json`

Review the dry-run output before applying:
- `validation_errors` must be empty
- `gate_errors` must be empty
- `parsed.capture_hora` must exist
- `parsed.serie_temporal` must be non-empty

If the final card has the new `0,3 x 0,7` layout and no timed series table, do **not** trust OCR operationally for that capture. Switch to vision/manual extraction and recompute the legacy vote-weighted consolidado instead.

### 3. Apply and rebuild

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_auto_update.py \
  --paredao N \
  --images-dir data/votalhada/YYYY_MM_DD \
  --apply \
  --build \
  --output tmp/votalhada_ocr/paredao_N_apply.json
```

This apply step:
- updates `data/votalhada/polls.json`
- keeps prior image history and appends only the new capture set
- rebuilds derived data after the apply

Optional render check after apply:

```bash
quarto render paredao.qmd
```

### Optional debugging and audit tools

Focused batch gate for the same latest capture set:

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_ocr_batch_validate.py \
  --images-root data/votalhada \
  --folders YYYY_MM_DD \
  --paredao N \
  --fail-on-errors
```

For OCR research / historical audits, run the same validator against the full folder history:

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_ocr_batch_validate.py \
  --images-root data/votalhada \
  --folders YYYY_MM_DD \
  --paredao N \
  --scope full-history \
  --fail-on-errors
```

`full-history` is expected to surface older noisy/conflicted captures. That does **not** mean the current latest capture is bad.

Fallback raw parser (Consolidado-only)

Use the OCR parser on the fetched folder:

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_ocr_feasibility.py \
  --images-dir data/votalhada/YYYY_MM_DD \
  --paredao N \
  --debug \
  --output tmp/votalhada_ocr/paredao_N_latest.json
```

The parser is **content-based**:
- It scans all PNGs and selects the best `consolidado_data` image by OCR signature.
- It does **not** rely on fixed filename index (`consolidados_5`, `consolidados_6`, etc.).
- It uses only the selected consolidado card (top+bottom crops from the same file), not platform cards.

The parser supports dynamic top-table schemas seen across BBB25/BBB26:
- 3-platform: `Sites`, `YouTube`, `Twitter`
- 4-platform with `Instagram`
- 4-platform with `Outras Redes`
- split rows `Média Threads` + `Média Instagram`

### Validation reference

From the OCR output JSON:
- `validation_errors` must be empty
- `parsed.serie_temporal` must be non-empty
- `parsed.capture_hora` must exist
- inspect `parsed.time_corrections` and `parsed.time_warnings` (report them in update notes)

Current parser safeguards for known Votalhada card quirks:
- Platform sums allow small display-rounding drift (up to ~`0.60`), because some source cards visibly round to values like `100.55` or `100.37` on YouTube.
- If a series row has valid date/time + 3 percentages but OCR misses the rightmost votes cell, parser backfills votes from consolidado/platform totals.
- For single-row fallback captures, parser uses the image filename date (`YYYY-MM-DD`) to correct clearly noisy OCR day/month tokens.
- For suspicious rollover OCR slips (`03:00`/`03:30`), parser applies guarded repair to `08:00`/`08:30` and logs it under `time_corrections`.

Current limitation (updated March 16, 2026):
- Platform extraction works on both old and new card layouts
- Series extraction and capture time (hora) have known issues on the new layout — OCR may miss series rows or misread midnight cards
- Use vision/manual fallback for series data until these issues are resolved

If any validation error appears, stop and inspect with vision before editing `data/votalhada/polls.json`.

Time sanity checklist before applying:
- `capture_hora` must match the latest bottom-table row and the top-right hour on the selected consolidado card.
- repeated `HH:MM` across different days is valid (do not collapse by time-only).
- if `time_corrections` is non-empty, verify corrected rows with vision before writing `polls.json`.

Recommended OCR regression tests before changing parser behavior:

```bash
pytest -q \
  tests/test_votalhada_ocr_batch_validate.py \
  tests/test_votalhada_ocr_feasibility.py \
  tests/test_votalhada_platform_consistency_audit.py \
  tests/test_fetch_votalhada_images.py
```

### Historical series handling

`serie_temporal` in consolidado is cumulative: each new capture adds rows over time.

Rules when applying OCR results:
- `serie_temporal`: append only new `hora` entries; never delete existing past rows
- `consolidado` and `plataformas`: overwrite with latest snapshot
- `data_coleta`: overwrite with latest capture timestamp

Quick regression check between two OCR outputs (`prev.json` and `curr.json`):

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json
from pathlib import Path

prev = json.loads(Path("tmp/votalhada_ocr/prev.json").read_text())
curr = json.loads(Path("tmp/votalhada_ocr/curr.json").read_text())

prev_rows = prev["parsed"]["serie_temporal"]
curr_rows = curr["parsed"]["serie_temporal"]
print("prev_rows:", len(prev_rows), "curr_rows:", len(curr_rows))
print("prev_capture:", prev["parsed"]["capture_hora"])
print("curr_capture:", curr["parsed"]["capture_hora"])
PY
```

Expected behavior:
- `curr_rows >= prev_rows` in most captures
- If `curr_capture_hora` is newer, the latest vote total should not decrease

### Detailed apply reference

After OCR validation passes:
Preferred apply command:

```bash
python scripts/votalhada_auto_update.py \
  --paredao N \
  --images-dir data/votalhada/YYYY_MM_DD \
  --apply \
  --build \
  --output tmp/votalhada_ocr/paredao_N_apply.json
```

What it does:
1. append new series rows by `hora`
2. overwrite latest `consolidado` and `plataformas`
3. set `predicao_eliminado` to participant with highest consolidado %
4. update `data_coleta`
5. preserve all historical image paths already stored in `polls.json`

**AI Agent Instructions**: See `data/votalhada/README.md` → "AI Agent Instructions" for detailed parsing rules.

### Paredão Falso ("Quem SALVAR?") handling

For Paredão Falso polls, set these extra fields in the poll entry:

```json
{
  "tipo_voto": "salvar",
  "paredao_falso": true
}
```

- **`tipo_voto: "salvar"`** — marks this as a save poll (vote to save, not eliminate). Most voted goes to Quarto Secreto. Prediction logic is the same (most voted = selected).
- **`predicao_eliminado`** in `consolidado` — set to the **most** voted participant (same as normal paredões).
- QMD pages auto-detect `tipo_voto` and display "Quem você quer SALVAR?" header + Paredão Falso warning banner.

### Verify name matching

Votalhada uses short names. Always match to API names:

| Votalhada Shows | Use in polls.json |
|-----------------|-------------------|
| "Aline" | "Aline Campos" |
| "Ana Paula" | "Ana Paula Renault" |
| "Cowboy" / "A Cowboy" | "Alberto Cowboy" |
| "Sol" | "Sol Vega" |
| "Floss" | "Juliano Floss" |

### Rebuild, commit, publish + deploy

**This step is critical** — without it, poll data won't appear on the live site (index.qmd AND paredao.qmd both need a fresh deploy).

```bash
# 1. Rebuild derived data
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# 2. Verify locally (recommended — catches rendering issues before deploy)
quarto render paredao.qmd    # Check "Enquetes" section renders correctly

# 3. Commit
git add data/ && git commit -m "votalhada polls paredão N"

# 4. Push to main
git push origin main

# 5. Deploy (REQUIRED — push alone does NOT trigger a render)
gh workflow run daily-update.yml
```

**Common mistake**: Pushing to `main` without dispatching the workflow. The cron only deploys when the API data hash changes — manual data updates (polls.json, paredoes.json) require explicit `gh workflow run`.

**Full extraction workflow and AI agent instructions**: See `data/votalhada/README.md`.

## Elimination Result Checklist (Tuesday)

After the elimination result is announced (~23h BRT):

> **Paredão Falso**: The same checklist applies. Set `status: "finalizado"`, fill `resultado` with the "eliminated" name (who goes to Quarto Secreto) and vote percentages as normal. The `paredao_falso: true` flag in `paredoes.json` ensures the pipeline treats it correctly (Cartola awards `quarto_secreto` points instead of elimination).

### 0. Scrape the result article

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<resultado-paredao-url>" -o docs/scraped/
```

The article contains exact vote percentages (Voto Único, Voto Torcida, Média) for all nominees.

### 1. Update `data/paredoes.json`

Set the status to `finalizado`, add vote results, and add the article to `fontes`:

```json
{
  "status": "finalizado",
  "resultado": {
    "eliminado": "Name",
    "votos": {
      "Name1": {"voto_unico": 45.23, "voto_torcida": 50.10, "voto_total": 46.69},
      "Name2": {"voto_unico": 54.77, "voto_torcida": 49.90, "voto_total": 53.31}
    }
  },
  "fontes": [
    {"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "Result article title"}
  ]
}
```

**Voting system (BBB 26)**: Voto Único (CPF, 70%) + Voto da Torcida (unlimited, 30%) = Média Final (`voto_total`).

**Where to find data**: The scraped article, or search `BBB 26 Nº paredão porcentagem resultado`.

### 1b. Update `data/manual_events.json` → `participants` (required for real elimination)

For a normal (non-fake) elimination, register the participant exit entry:

```json
{
  "participants": {
    "Name": {
      "status": "eliminado",
      "exit_date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "paredao_numero": N,
      "fontes": ["<resultado-url>"]
    }
  }
}
```

- Use `status: "eliminado"` or `status: "eliminada"` (both accepted).
- For `desistente`/`desclassificado`, the same shape applies: `status` + `exit_date` + `fontes`.
- **Do not use legacy keys** like `date`, `week`, `paredao`, `detail` in `participants` — they are not the operational contract for Cartola exit scoring.
- **Paredão Falso**: do not add participant exit in `participants` (the person remains active and gets `quarto_secreto` points from `paredoes.json`).
- **Why this is mandatory**: without this entry, Cartola may keep the eliminated participant as active and miss the `eliminado` (−20) event.

### 2. Update `data/votalhada/polls.json`

Add `resultado_real` to the paredão's poll entry:

```json
{
  "resultado_real": {
    "Name1": 45.23,
    "Name2": 54.77,
    "eliminado": "Name2",
    "predicao_correta": true
  }
}
```

- Use `voto_total` (not `voto_unico` or `voto_torcida`) for the percentages — this matches what Votalhada predicted against.
- Set `predicao_correta` to `true` if `consolidado.predicao_eliminado` matches `resultado_real.eliminado`, otherwise `false`.
- For Paredão Falso: "eliminado" = who went to Quarto Secreto (most voted to save).

### 2b. Rebuild + Cartola + model sanity check (required before commit)

```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# Normal elimination: eliminated participant must have week-N "eliminado" and active=false
jq '.leaderboard[] | select(.name=="Name") | {name,active,week_events:(.events|map(select(.week==N)))}' data/derived/cartola_data.json

# Paredão falso: selected participant must have "quarto_secreto" (not "eliminado")
jq '.leaderboard[] | select(.name=="Name") | {name,active,week_events:(.events|map(select(.week==N)))}' data/derived/cartola_data.json
```

Expected:
- Normal elimination: event list includes `["eliminado", -20, "YYYY-MM-DD"]`, and `active: false`.
- Paredão Falso: event list includes `["quarto_secreto", 40, "YYYY-MM-DD"]`, and participant remains active.

Model sanity check (Votalhada + Nosso Modelo, after `resultado_real` update):

```bash
python - <<'PY'
import json
import sys
from pathlib import Path

sys.path.append("scripts")
from data_utils import calculate_precision_weights, backtest_precision_model

polls = json.loads(Path("data/votalhada/polls.json").read_text(encoding="utf-8"))
finalized = [p for p in polls.get("paredoes", []) if p.get("resultado_real")]
precision = calculate_precision_weights(polls)
backtest = backtest_precision_model(polls) or {}
agg = (backtest.get("aggregate") or {})

print({
    "finalized_with_resultado_real": len(finalized),
    "precision_n_paredoes": precision.get("n_paredoes"),
    "weights": precision.get("weights"),
    "model_correct": agg.get("model_correct"),
    "votalhada_correct": agg.get("consolidado_correct"),
    "n_paredoes_backtest": agg.get("n_paredoes"),
})
PY
```

Expected:
- `precision_n_paredoes` equals `finalized_with_resultado_real`
- `n_paredoes_backtest` equals `finalized_with_resultado_real`
- `weights` are non-empty when enough finalized paredões exist

### 3. Record Ganha-Ganha (same night, ~23h30)

The Ganha-Ganha happens right after elimination. Three participants are drawn by lot. One gets the veto power (eliminates one of the other two from the dynamic). The remaining participant chooses between a cash prize or privileged information.

#### 0. Scrape the article

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<ganha-ganha-url>" -o docs/scraped/
```

The article contains all the details: who was drawn, who vetoed whom, and what the remaining participant chose. Use it as the source for filling the fields below.

Add **two things** to `data/manual_events.json`:

#### A. `weekly_events[N].ganha_ganha`

```json
{
  "ganha_ganha": {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "sorteados": ["Name1", "Name2", "Name3"],
    "cartas": "Description of what happened with the cards/draw",
    "veto": {
      "por": "Who had veto power",
      "quem": "Who was vetoed (eliminated from the dynamic)"
    },
    "decisao": {
      "quem": "Who made the final choice",
      "escolha": "informação privilegiada",
      "abriu_mao": "R$ 10 mil (dobrar para R$ 20 mil)"
    },
    "informacao": "Content of the privileged information if disclosed in the article",
    "fontes": ["<article-url>"]
  }
}
```

**Field reference**:

| Field | Values | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| `sorteados` | `["A", "B", "C"]` | Always 3 participants drawn by lot |
| `veto.por` | Name | Person who had veto power |
| `veto.quem` | Name | Person removed from the dynamic |
| `decisao.quem` | Name | Person who chose between prize and info |
| `decisao.escolha` | `"informação privilegiada"` or `"R$ X mil"` | What they picked |
| `decisao.abriu_mao` | String | What they gave up |
| `informacao` | String or `null` | Content of privileged info when the article reveals it, even if the participant chose the cash instead |

If the participant takes the money, keep `decisao.escolha` / `decisao.abriu_mao` aligned with the cash outcome and still fill `informacao` whenever gshow reveals the hidden message to the audience after the choice.

#### B. Two `power_events` entries

```json
[
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "week": N,
    "type": "veto_ganha_ganha",
    "actor": "Vetoed person",
    "target": "Person who vetoed",
    "source": "Ganha-Ganha",
    "detail": "Foi vetado(a) por X na dinâmica do Ganha-Ganha.",
    "impacto": "negativo",
    "origem": "manual",
    "visibility": "public",
    "awareness": "known"
  },
  {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "week": N,
    "type": "ganha_ganha_escolha",
    "actor": "Person who chose",
    "target": "Person who vetoed",
    "source": "Ganha-Ganha",
    "detail": "Ficou com a decisão na dinâmica após o veto de X em Y.",
    "impacto": "positivo",
    "origem": "manual",
    "visibility": "public",
    "awareness": "known"
  }
]
```

**Note on `actor`/`target` in veto**: The `actor` is the **vetoed person** (they receive the negative impact), `target` is the person who did the veto. This matches the relations scoring direction (impact flows toward the actor).

**Reminder**: Every `power_event` entry **must** include a `fontes` array with the source URL. The audit (`build_derived_data.py`) will hard-fail if `fontes` is missing.

### 4. Rebuild, verify cronologia, commit, publish + deploy

```bash
# 1. Rebuild derived data
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# 2. Verify cronologia has the new events
python3 -c "
import json
gt = json.load(open('data/derived/game_timeline.json'))
events = gt.get('events', gt) if isinstance(gt, dict) else gt
today = [e for e in events if isinstance(e, dict) and e.get('date') == 'YYYY-MM-DD']
for e in today:
    print(f'  {e.get(\"category\"):25s} | {e.get(\"title\",\"\"):50s} | source={e.get(\"source\")}')
"
# Expected: paredao_resultado + ganha_ganha + power_events all present
# If missing: check that manual_events.json and paredoes.json are saved correctly

# 3. Commit
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "public: data: paredão N result + ganha-ganha"

# 4. Push + deploy
git pull --rebase origin main && git push origin main
gh workflow run daily-update.yml
```

**Always verify the cronologia after rebuild** — it's the single source of truth for the game timeline on index.qmd and evolucao.qmd. Missing events here means they won't appear on the site.

**Cronologia display order**: Latest event on top within each day (consistent with newest-first for weeks and dates). Controlled by `CATEGORY_ORDER` in `scripts/builders/timeline.py` (lower number = earlier in the day = displayed at bottom).

Expected display order (top → bottom):

```
Elim night: ganha_ganha_escolha → veto_ganha_ganha → ganha_ganha → paredao_resultado  ← top (latest)
Live show:  barrado_baile → sincerao
Ceremony:   paredao_formacao → paredao_bate_volta → paredao_contragolpe →
            dinamica → paredao_votacao → paredao_indicacao → paredao_imunidade
Afternoon:  presente_anjo → big_fone
Morning:    anjo → monstro → lider
Meta:       saida → entrada                                                            ← bottom (earliest)
```

**Note**: Presente do Anjo happens early in the day (Almoço do Anjo, afternoon) — it just gets shown on the live TV show later. The `CATEGORY_ORDER` reflects when the event actually occurs, not when it airs.

If events appear in the wrong order, check `CATEGORY_ORDER` values.

**Cronologia detail text**: The timeline builder auto-generates details from structured data:
- `paredao_resultado`: from `paredoes.json` resultado (e.g., "Breno eliminado (58.96%)")
- `ganha_ganha`: built from `veto`/`decisao` fields (e.g., "Marciele vetou Samira; Jordana escolheu R$ 20 mil")
- `power_events`: uses the `detail` field directly
- Scaffolds (generic placeholders) are suppressed when real events exist for the same (date, category) or (week, category) for singletons

### What auto-updates after rebuild + deploy

Once `build_derived_data.py` runs and the site deploys, the following update **automatically** — no manual action needed:

| What | Where | Details |
|------|-------|---------|
| **Cartola BBB points** | `cartola_data.json` → `cartola.qmd` | For normal paredão: `emparedado` (−15), `eliminado` (−20), `nao_eliminado_paredao` (+20), plus `nao_emparedado` (+10)/`nao_recebeu_votos` (+5) when applicable. For fake: selected participant gets `quarto_secreto` (+40). |
| **Paredão archival** | `paredao_analysis.json` → `paredoes.qmd` | Finalized paredão moves to the archive page with full analysis (votos da casa, reaction heatmap, formation timeline). |
| **Prediction model recalibration** | `vote_prediction.json` → `paredao.qmd` | The **Modelo Ponderado por Precisão** recalculates weights using all finalized `resultado_real` entries. RMSE per platform, weights, and backtest results update automatically. |
| **Votação page** | `votacao.qmd` | Voto Único vs Voto Torcida analysis updates with the new paredão's voting breakdown. |
| **Current paredão page** | `paredao.qmd` | Switches from "EM VOTAÇÃO" to result display. Shows "Enquetes vs Resultado" comparison instead of prediction cards. |
| **Elimination detection** | `eliminations_detected.json` | Participant disappearance from API triggers auto-detection (for real eliminations). For Paredão Falso, participant stays in API. |
| **Game timeline** | `game_timeline.json` → `index.qmd`, `evolucao.qmd` | `paredao_resultado` event auto-generated from finalized paredão. |
| **Relations scores** | `relations_scores.json` | Paredão-anchored scores frozen at formation date snapshot. |

**No manual action needed for any of the above** — just rebuild, push, and deploy.

### Paredão Falso display handling

When `paredao_falso: true` is set in `paredoes.json`, the entire display layer automatically adapts:

| Component | Regular Paredão | Paredão Falso |
|-----------|----------------|---------------|
| **Timeline** (`game_timeline.json`) | "Breno eliminado (54.66%)" 🏁 | "Breno → Quarto Secreto (54.66%)" 🔮 |
| **Transformed resultado** (`load_paredoes_transformed`) | `ELIMINADA` | `QUARTO_SECRETO` |
| **Nominee badge** (`get_nominee_badge()`) | "ELIMINADO" 🔴 red | "🔮 Q. SECRETO" 🔮 purple |
| **paredoes.qmd summary table** | "Eliminado(a)" (normal) | Same column; fake week marked by 🔮 in "Nº" |
| **paredoes.qmd tab label** | "7º Paredão (Breno)" | "7º Paredão Falso (Breno)" |
| **paredoes.qmd history rows** | "Elim." red | "🔮 Q. Secreto" purple |
| **paredao.qmd precision label** | "(eliminado)" | "(→ quarto secreto)" |
| **paredao.qmd result cards** | "ELIMINADO" red border | "🔮 Q. SECRETO" red border |
| **votacao.qmd health cards** | 🎯/🛡️ icons, "eliminação" language | ⬆️/⬇️ icons, "salvação" language |
| **votacao.qmd editorial** | "forçar eliminação" | "forçar salvação" |
| **Cartola points** | `eliminado` (−20) | `quarto_secreto` (+40) |

Generic analytical text uses "mais votado" instead of "eliminado" across all pattern/accuracy displays (works for both types).

**No manual overrides needed** — the `paredao_falso: true` flag drives all display logic.

### Quarto Secreto Return

When a participant returns from Quarto Secreto:
- **API auto-detects** the `Imune` role — no manual participant entry needed.
- The returned participant has full queridômetro data (reactions given and received).
- `weekly_events[N].quarto_secreto` schema (see W7 data for reference): `{"retorno_date": "YYYY-MM-DD", "convidado": "Name", "escolha": "..."}`.
- `quarto_secreto_convite` edge (+0.20) is auto-created from `weekly_events[N].quarto_secreto.convidado` in the relations builder.
- Immunity lasts for the next paredão formation only.

## Barrado no Baile Checklist (Wednesday)

Use this checklist when the Líder (or liderança dupla) bars someone from the Festa do Líder.

### 0. Scrape the source article

```bash
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<barrado-no-baile-url>" -o docs/scraped/
```

Example source (liderança dupla):
- `https://gshow.globo.com/realities/bbb/bbb-26/festa/noticia/barrado-no-baile-ana-paula-renault-e-escolhida-pelos-lideres-jonas-sulzbach-e-alberto-cowboy.ghtml`

If the task description and the source URL/title disagree, trust the **article title/body** and update the event the source actually describes. Wednesday `festa/` links often describe **Barrado no Baile**, even when a request casually says "ganha-ganha".

### 1. Add/update `data/manual_events.json` → `weekly_events[N].barrado_baile` + `power_events`

First, keep the week-level mirror in sync:

```json
{
  "barrado_baile": [
    {
      "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
      "lider": "Lider A",
      "alvo": "Emparedado"
    }
  ]
}
```

Then add one `barrado_baile` power event:

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "week": N,
  "type": "barrado_baile",
  "actor": "Lider A + Lider B",
  "actors": ["Lider A", "Lider B"],
  "target": "Emparedado",
  "source": "Barrado no Baile",
  "detail": "Líder(es) escolheu(ram) X para ficar fora da festa e enfrentar desafio.",
  "fontes": ["<barrado-no-baile-url>"],
  "impacto": "negativo",
  "origem": "manual",
  "visibility": "public",
  "awareness": "known"
}
```

Single-líder case: keep only `actor: "Name"` (the optional `actors` array is mainly for consensus/duo actions).
Keep `weekly_events[].barrado_baile` updated because `scripts/update_programa_doc.py` renders `docs/PROGRAMA_BBB26.md` from week-level metadata, while the timeline/scoring layers consume the `power_events` entry.

### 2. Rebuild + validate

```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py
python scripts/update_programa_doc.py

# Verify the week mirror was stored as expected
jq '.weekly_events[] | select(.week==N) | .barrado_baile' data/manual_events.json

# Verify the power event was stored as expected
jq '.power_events[] | select(.type=="barrado_baile" and .date=="YYYY-MM-DD")' data/manual_events.json
```

Expected:
- week mirror includes `lider` / `alvo`
- `type = "barrado_baile"`
- `actor`/`target` names match API spelling
- source URL present in `fontes`

### 3. Commit + publish

Follow [Commit & Publish Workflow](#commit--publish-workflow):
```bash
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md docs/PROGRAMA_BBB26.md
git commit -m "barrado no baile W{N} (Target)"
# Then push origin/main and trigger deploy if needed — see Commit & Publish Workflow
```

### 4. Update scheduled event

If `scheduled_events` has a `barrado_baile` placeholder for that date/week, **update it** with the real result (who was barred, by whom). Do NOT delete it — the auto-dedup suppresses it once the real event is recorded, and deleting prematurely leaves a timeline gap.

---

## Sincerão Update (Monday)

After the Monday live show (~22h BRT):

### 1. Scrape Sincerão articles

```bash
# Main overview article:
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<sincerao-url>" -o docs/scraped/

# For "Linha Direta" format (one article per participant), scrape all individual articles:
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<url-1>" -o docs/scraped/
python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<url-2>" -o docs/scraped/
# ... repeat for each participant
```

### 2. Update `data/manual_events.json` → `weekly_events[N].sincerao`

Add a Sincerão entry (single `dict` or `list` of dicts for multiple rounds):

```json
{
  "sincerao": {
    "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
    "format": "Description of this week's format",
    "participacao": ["Name1", "Name2"],
    "protagonistas": [],
    "notes": "Summary of what happened, key confrontations, target tally",
    "fontes": ["<sincerao-url>"],
    "stats": {
      "most_targeted": [{"name": "X", "count": 4}],
      "not_targeted": ["Y"],
      "mutual_confrontations": [["A", "B"]]
    },
    "edges": [
      {"actor": "A", "target": "B", "type": "ataque", "tema": "maior traidor(a)"}
    ],
    "edges_notes": "Context about edge extraction"
  }
}
```

**Aggregation rule for `stats`**:
- `most_targeted`, `not_targeted`, and `mutual_confrontations` should reflect the **aggregate round**, not just one plaque/sub-step.
- If the format has multiple negative choices per participant (for example, 2 plaques in the same round), count **all directed signals together** in `most_targeted`.
- If a format also has meaningful per-plaque leaders, keep those details in `notes` instead of inventing ad-hoc top-level keys.

**Edge types** (must match Sincerão builders):

| Type | Weight | When to use |
|------|--------|-------------|
| `elogio` (+ `slot`: 1/2/3) | +0.6 / +0.4 / +0.2 | Directed positive endorsement (e.g., positive podium “quem ganha”) |
| `regua` | +0.25 (aggregate mention) | Participant places someone in Top-3 priority/régua |
| `nao_ganha` | −0.8 | Participant says someone won't win |
| `regua_fora` | −0.5 (aggregate mention) | Participant leaves someone out of the régua |
| `ataque` (+ `tema`) | −0.6 | Directed negative confrontation: themes, medals, accusations, etc. |
| `paredao_perfeito` | −0.3 | Participant nominates someone for ideal paredão |
| `prova_eliminou` | −0.15 | Eliminated someone in a Sincerão sub-game |
| `quem_sai` | contextual (negative signal) | Explicit “quem sai hoje” indication |

**Negative podium formats** (e.g., “Pódio dos Medrosos” W8): When the podium theme is negative (calling someone cowardly, etc.), use `ataque` with `tema` = the specific medal/label given (e.g., `”covarde”`, `”frouxo”`, `”arregão”`). Add `”slot”: 1/2/3` to preserve rank position (scoring is flat −0.8 per edge, but slot preserves data granularity). Do **NOT** use `elogio` for negative podiums — `elogio` is hardcoded positive in the scoring pipeline.

**Dual-label negative formats** (for example, “quem faz alguém de bobo” + “quem está sendo feito de bobo”):
- Record **one directed edge per plaque**.
- If both plaques are negative judgments, keep them on `type = "ataque"` and distinguish them with `tema`.
- Prefer existing types (`ataque`, `elogio`, `nao_ganha`) unless the format truly introduces a new semantic category that cannot be represented safely.

**When article bullets conflict with the spoken justification**:
- Treat the **spoken justification as canonical** for actor → target extraction.
- Preserve the discrepancy in `notes` so future editors understand why the JSON does not mirror the bullet list literally.
- If the article text is clearly truncated and only explains one of two picks, it is acceptable to preserve the unexplained pick from the bullet list and document that fallback in `notes`.

**`stats` structure varies by format:**
- Positive formats: use `podio_top` (most podium placements), `sem_podio` (not placed), `nao_ganha_top`
- Negative / ataque formats: use `most_targeted` (most targeted), `not_targeted` (not targeted), `mutual_confrontations`
- Directed formats (Linha Direta): use `most_targeted`, `not_targeted`, `mutual_confrontations`

After rebuild, verify type coverage and unknown types:

```bash
jq '.sincerao.type_coverage' data/derived/index_data.json
```

If `.unknown` is non-empty, update `SINC_TYPE_META` in `scripts/builders/index_data_builder.py` before publishing.

**Current index card support**:
- The current Sincerão highlight card in `index_data.json` only surfaces the contradiction/alignment pair lanes from `elogio`, `nao_ganha`, and `ataque`.
- The radar can still count other mapped Sincerão types when they have valence metadata.
- If you add a brand-new edge type and expect it to appear in the current card, update both `SINC_TYPE_META` **and** the highlight filters in `scripts/builders/index_data_builder.py`.

**Backlash** (auto-generated reverse edge, target → actor): `nao_ganha` 0.3, `ataque` 0.4.

**Full Sincerão schema**: See `docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md` → Sincerão Framework.

### 3. Rebuild + commit + publish

Follow [Commit & Publish Workflow](#commit--publish-workflow):
```bash
python scripts/build_derived_data.py
git add data/ docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_AUDIT.md docs/SCORING_AND_INDEXES.md
git commit -m "week N sincerão"
# Then push origin/main and trigger deploy if needed — see Commit & Publish Workflow
```

**Required post-rebuild spot checks**:
```bash
jq '.events[] | select(.date=="YYYY-MM-DD" and .category=="sincerao") | {date, source, detail}' data/derived/game_timeline.json
jq '.highlights.cards[] | select(.type=="sincerao") | {title, format, reaction_reference_date}' data/derived/index_data.json
```

Expected:
- `game_timeline.json` shows the real Monday event with `source = "weekly_events"` (not `scaffold`)
- `index_data.json` exposes a `type = "sincerao"` card for the current week when supported edge types are present

---

## Scheduled Events (upcoming week)

Future events displayed in the Cronologia do Jogo with dashed borders, 🔮 prefix, and yellow time badge.

### Adding scheduled events

Add to `data/manual_events.json` → `scheduled_events` array:

```json
{
  "date": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "week": N,
  "category": "paredao_formacao",
  "emoji": "🗳️",
  "title": "Event Title",
  "detail": "Brief description",
  "time": "Ao Vivo",
  "fontes": ["<dynamics-article-url>"]
}
```

**`time` field rules**:
- `"Ao Vivo"` — event will happen during the **daily prime-time TV show** (the evening broadcast). Future events only.
- `"A definir"` — time/broadcast not confirmed yet. Future events only.
- `"7h"`, `"14h"`, etc. — specific scheduled or known time. Can be used for **both** future and past events when the event had a specific announced time (e.g., Big Fone at 14h, pre-announced dynamic at 7h).
- **After the event happens**: removing `time` is optional — past events are automatically resolved by the date-based lifecycle. However, removing `time` on the same day accelerates the visual transition from dashed→solid for same-day rendering.

**Automatic lifecycle**: The timeline builder uses the event date to determine display style — **no manual flag needed**:
- **Past** (date < today) → always displayed as a real event (solid borders, no 🔮). If a real auto-generated event already exists for the same `(date, category)`, the entry is suppressed as redundant.
- **Today with `time`** → still scheduled (event is tonight)
- **Today without `time`** → resolved (already happened today)
- **Future** → always scheduled (dashed borders, 🔮 prefix, yellow time badge)

This means you can schedule events, update their title/detail/fontes when they happen, and the Cronologia automatically transitions them from scheduled→real styling the next day. No need to remove `time` or set a `resolved` flag.

**Common categories for scheduling**: `sincerao`, `ganha_ganha`, `barrado_baile`, `anjo`, `monstro`, `presente_anjo`, `paredao_formacao`, `paredao_resultado`, `dinamica`.

**Auto-generated categories** (from `paredoes.json`, do NOT schedule these): `paredao_imunidade`, `paredao_indicacao`, `paredao_votacao`, `paredao_contragolpe`, `paredao_bate_volta`. These ceremony sub-steps are created automatically when formation data is filled. See [Paredão Formation → Auto-generated Ceremony Sub-Steps](#auto-generated-ceremony-sub-steps-in-cronologia).

### Weekly schedule from dynamics article (required)

When a "Dinâmica da Semana" article is published, register the week schedule using this exact order:

1. Scrape first:
   ```bash
   python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<dinamica-semana-url>" -o docs/scraped/
   ```
2. Add the recurring weekly baseline template first (`anjo`, `monstro`, `presente_anjo`, `sincerao`, `paredao_formacao`, `paredao_resultado`, `ganha_ganha`, `barrado_baile`).
3. Extract week-specific dynamic entries by date/time from the scraped markdown.
4. Add these extra `dinamica` (and related) entries on top of the baseline.
5. Keep unresolved roles explicit:
   - If Líder is not known yet, keep wording generic (`indicação do Líder vigente (a definir)`).
   - If VIP list is not known yet, do not infer names; wait for the VIP source and update only when confirmed.
6. Link provenance in each entry (`fontes`):
   - dynamics article URL
   - `docs/scraped/<arquivo>.md`
7. Run the baseline verification command in [Baseline weekly template (reference; most slots auto-scaffolded)](#baseline-weekly-template-reference-most-slots-auto-scaffolded) before commit.

**Example mapped from**  
`https://gshow.globo.com/realities/bbb/bbb-26/noticia/dinamica-da-semana-tem-maquina-do-poder-e-participantes-emparedados-no-sabado-14-entenda.ghtml`

| Date | Category | Suggested title | Operational note |
|------|----------|-----------------|------------------|
| 2026-03-14 | `anjo` | Prova do Anjo | Standard Saturday flow |
| 2026-03-14 | `monstro` | Castigo do Monstro | Recurring weekly event (even if not explicit in article) |
| 2026-03-14 | `dinamica` | Dinâmica ao vivo: 3 emparedados | These 3 feed Sunday formation |
| 2026-03-15 | `presente_anjo` | Presente do Anjo | Anjo escolhe entre vídeo da família ou 2ª imunidade + almoço |
| 2026-03-15 | `paredao_formacao` | Formação do Paredão (duas partes) | Include `indicação do Líder vigente (a definir)` until Líder is confirmed |
| 2026-03-15 | `dinamica` | Máquina do Poder (salvação de emparedado) | Winner of caixa premiada can save one of Saturday's 3 emparedados |
| 2026-03-16 | `sincerao` | Sincerão | Recurring weekly Monday live event |
| 2026-03-17 | `paredao_resultado` | Eliminação | Normal Tuesday result |
| 2026-03-17 | `ganha_ganha` | Ganha-Ganha | Recurring Tuesday post-elimination dynamic |
| 2026-03-18 | `barrado_baile` | Barrado no Baile | Recurring Wednesday event |

**Important**: do not fill `formacao.lider`, `formacao.indicado_lider`, or `provas.lider.vip` from the dynamics schedule article alone. Use the dedicated Líder/VIP source flow in [Líder Transition Checklist](#líder-transition-checklist-thursday-night).

### Auto-dedup behavior

- `build_game_timeline()` merges scheduled events with real events
- Two-tier dedup: **singleton categories** (anjo, lider, paredao_formacao, sincerao, ganha_ganha, etc.) are always suppressed when a real event exists on the same `(date, category)`. **Non-singleton categories** (monstro, dinamica) are suppressed when *resolved* (past date, or same-day without `time`) or by exact title match
- **Lifecycle**: past events (`date < reference_date`) are always *resolved* (solid display, category-deduped). Same-day without `time` → resolved. Same-day with `time` or future → *pending* (dashed border + 🔮). Removing `time` is optional — past events transition automatically
- Líder source priority: API `auto_events` first; fallback to `provas.json` (`tipo=lider`) when API data is late
- **Never delete scheduled events prematurely** — always update them with real results first. Clean up old entries only during the next week's Líder Transition setup, after the API has captured the roles

## Manual Data Files — When and How

### 1. `data/manual_events.json`

**When**: After any power event, Big Fone, Sincerão, special dynamic, exit, or scheduled event.

**Common entries** (by frequency):
- `power_events` — contragolpe, veto, imunidade, ganha-ganha, barrado
- `weekly_events` — Big Fone, Sincerão, Anjo details, confessão de voto, dedo-duro
- `special_events` — dinâmicas especiais
- `scheduled_events` — upcoming events (with auto-dedup)
- `participants` — **all exits** (eliminações, desistências, desclassificações)

**Pitfalls**:
- Names must match API exactly (see `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` → data contracts)
- Consensus events: use `"actor": "A + B + C"` + `"actors": ["A","B","C"]`
- Barrado no Baile with liderança dupla: use both `actor` (joined string) and `actors` (array) to preserve attribution.
- `participants` must use the current contract:
  - required keys: `status`, `exit_date`
  - recommended: `paredao_numero` (for eliminações), `fontes`
  - avoid legacy keys in this object (`date`, `week`, `paredao`, `detail`)
- `build_derived_data.py` hard-fails on audit issues — fix before pushing

**Full schema**: `docs/MANUAL_EVENTS_GUIDE.md`

### 2. `data/paredoes.json`

**When**: At paredão skeleton creation (Thursday), formation (Sunday), and result (Tuesday).

**Key pitfalls**:
- Use `indicados_finais` (NOT `participantes`) for nominee list
- `formacao.lider` is nested under `formacao`, NOT top-level
- `resultado.votos.{name}.{voto_unico, voto_torcida, voto_total}` — NOT `percentuais`
- `fontes` are objects: `{"url": "...", "arquivo": "docs/scraped/...", "titulo": "..."}`
- For fake eliminations, add `"paredao_falso": true`
- At new paredão creation, always confirm this question: **"Fechamento previsto continua terça ~22:45 BRT?"**
  - If the answer is "no" (common near finals), register the real closing schedule in `data/votalhada/polls.json` using `fechamento_votacao`.

**Full schema**: See `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (data contracts) + templates in this guide.

### 3. `data/provas.json`

**When**: After Prova do Líder (Thursday), Prova do Anjo (Saturday), Bate e Volta (Sunday).

**Workflow**: Add entry to the `provas` array with `numero`, `tipo`, `week`, `date`, `vencedor`, `fases`, `fontes`. See [Anjo Checklist](#anjo--monstro-update-checklist-saturday) and [Líder Checklist](#líder-transition-checklist-thursday-night) for templates.

If the ranking is intentionally partial, include `nota_ranking` in the prova entry instead of leaving the limitation implicit.

### 4. `data/votalhada/polls.json`

**When**: Tuesday ~21h (before elimination) and after result.

**Workflow**: See [Votalhada Collection Checklist](#votalhada-collection-checklist-tuesday).

**Full extraction workflow**: `data/votalhada/README.md`.

### `cartola_points_log` (manual overrides)

For Cartola events **not auto-detected** from API snapshots or derived data. Rarely needed — most events are now auto-detected.

**Schema** (in `data/manual_events.json`):
```json
{
  "participant": "Name",
  "week": N,
  "reason": "Why this manual entry is needed",
  "fonte": "https://...",
  "events": [
    {"event": "event_type", "points": N}
  ]
}
```

**Auto-detected types** (will be ignored if added here): `lider`, `anjo`, `monstro`, `emparedado`, `imunizado`, `vip`, `desistente`, `eliminado`, `desclassificado`, `atendeu_big_fone`, `monstro_retirado_vip`, `quarto_secreto`.

**What's auto-detected**:
- From API snapshots: `lider`, `anjo`, `monstro`, `imunizado`, `emparedado`, `vip`
- VIP strict source: `provas.json` (`tipo=lider` → `vip`, `vip_source`) plus `power_events.type=troca_vip`
- From manual data: `atendeu_big_fone`, `desistente`, `eliminado`, `desclassificado`
- From paredões: `salvo_paredao`, `nao_eliminado_paredao`, `nao_emparedado`, `nao_recebeu_votos`
  - Window exception: when `formacao.bate_volta.salvacao_com_janela_aberta: true` (or `janela_escalacao_aberta: true`), score only `emparedado` (skip `salvo_paredao`).
- Cross-checked: `monstro_retirado_vip` (Monstro recipient was in VIP in previous snapshot)
- Paredão Falso: `quarto_secreto` (+40, from `paredao_falso: true` + finalized result)

**Quick rule for `salvacao_com_janela_aberta`:**
- Set `true` only if the participant was emparedado while the Cartola window was closed, and escaped when the window was open.
- If uncertain, keep `false` and add a source note in `fontes` before changing scoring behavior.

### Janela de escalação (Cartola): como registrar e como funciona

Context: GShow can announce that the round window closed and that game dynamics start counting points from that moment (example, rodada 9):
- https://gshow.globo.com/realities/bbb/bbb-26/cartola-bbb/noticia/cartola-bbb-janela-de-escalacao-da-nona-rodada-fecha-e-dinamicas-passam-a-valer-ponto.ghtml

Operational registration:
1. Scrape and archive the supporting GShow page before any scoring change:
   ```bash
   python scripts/scrape_gshow.py "<url_cartola_janela>" -o docs/scraped/
   ```
2. In `data/paredoes.json` → `formacao.bate_volta`, set:
   - `"salvacao_com_janela_aberta": true`
   only when the participant entered paredão with window closed and escaped with window open.
3. Keep normal flow (`false` or omitted) for regular Bate e Volta cases.
4. If the closure schedule changed, also register the real voting close time in `data/votalhada/polls.json` (`fechamento_votacao`) for consistency in Tuesday operations.
5. Always add the supporting article URL and scraped file path in `fontes` before enabling the flag.

Scoring behavior in the pipeline:
- With `salvacao_com_janela_aberta: true`:
  - keeps `emparedado` (−15)
  - skips `salvo_paredao` (+25)
- Without the flag (`false`/omitted):
  - normal Bate e Volta applies (`emparedado` + `salvo_paredao`)

Important scope note:
- This flag is the explicit operational switch currently modeled for the Cartola window edge case in paredão salvation.
- Do not infer other window effects ad hoc; only encode what is backed by source and supported by current scoring rules.

### VIP scoring references (for audits)

Scrape and keep these pages in `docs/scraped/` for future verification:

## Economia / Compras Detection (automatic vs manual)

### How compras is detected today

`compras` is **auto-detected** in the derived pipeline from snapshot balance deltas.

- Source builder: `scripts/builders/balance.py` (`build_balance_events()`).
- Rule of thumb:
  - If losses affect >=80% of active participants (collective pattern), classify as `compras`.
  - Tiny gains in the same transition are tolerated (keeps event as `compras`).
  - Significant mixed gains/losses become `dinamica`.
- Output artifact: `data/derived/balance_events.json`:
  - `events[]` (includes `type="compras"`)
  - `compras_fairness.events[]` (VIP/Xepa percentages + per-capita economics fields)

### What is manual (and what is not)

- There is **no dedicated manual compras event entry** in `manual_events.json`.
- Manual files still matter for context:
  - `special_events` can reclassify certain balance events as special dynamics (e.g., Máquina do Poder).
  - Sources and narrative context are documented manually in weekly/special event records.

### Operator checks when numbers look suspicious

1. Confirm snapshots exist around the date (`data/snapshots/` cadence and timestamps).
2. Rebuild derived data:
   ```bash
   python scripts/build_derived_data.py
   ```
3. Inspect the detected event in `data/derived/balance_events.json` (`events` + `compras_fairness`).
4. Compare against official/source notes for that week (`docs/PROGRAMA_BBB26.md`, scraped sources).
5. If a special dynamic was misclassified, update `manual_events.json` (`special_events`) and rebuild.

## Screenshot Pipeline (Layout/Plot Review)

Use this pipeline when reviewing responsive layout, spacing, alignment, plots, and readability across all Quarto pages.

### Prerequisites

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
quarto --version
npx --version
```

If needed, install Playwright chromium once:

```bash
./scripts/capture_layout_screenshots.sh --install-browser --output-dir tmp/page_screenshots/bootstrap
```

### Recommended run sequence

1. Render site if data/templates changed:
```bash
quarto render
```
2. Run page-by-page full-page capture (desktop + mobile):
```bash
./scripts/capture_layout_screenshots.sh --output-dir tmp/page_screenshots/<label>
```
3. For very long pages or suspected mobile blank segments, run slice captures:
```bash
python scripts/capture_mobile_slices.py --output-dir tmp/page_screenshots/<label>-slices
```
4. Inspect manifests:
```bash
cat tmp/page_screenshots/<label>/manifest.json
cat tmp/page_screenshots/<label>-slices/manifest.json
```

### Sincerão QA checklist (mobile + desktop)

Run this checklist page-by-page after each capture cycle (`index`, `relacoes`, debug pages where applicable):

- Dense week (many Sincerão events): top entries are readable without horizontal scroll; overflow is accessible through `<details>`/expanded blocks.
- Sparse week (few events): no empty/broken containers; layout remains balanced.
- One-sided week (only positive or only negative): missing lanes show neutral empty-state text instead of blank space.
- Mixed week: `Atacados`, `Elogiados`, and `Contradições` are all visible and legible.
- Profile cards (`Recebeu`/`Fez`): chips wrap naturally on mobile; no clipped labels or forced horizontal swipe.
- Contradiction consistency: contradiction values in profile summaries and top-level radar/pairs are coherent for the same week.
- Visual density: desktop remains compact/scannable; mobile remains tappable with clear hierarchy.

### Core commands

Wrapper (recommended, page-by-page progress logs):

```bash
./scripts/capture_layout_screenshots.sh --render --output-dir tmp/page_screenshots/<label>
```

Direct script (fine-grained control):

```bash
python scripts/capture_quarto_screenshots.py \
  --render \
  --profiles desktop,mobile \
  --output-dir tmp/page_screenshots/<label>
```

Single page debug (helps detect slow/hanging perception):

```bash
python scripts/capture_quarto_screenshots.py \
  --profiles mobile \
  --page index.html \
  --verbose \
  --fail-fast \
  --output-dir tmp/page_screenshots/<label>
```

### Key flags

- `--render`: render Quarto before captures.
- `--install-browser`: wrapper option to install/update Playwright chromium.
- `--profiles desktop,mobile`: choose capture profiles.
- `--page <name>`: limit to a single page (`index.html`, `paredao.html`, etc.).
- `--verbose`: print per-page command and stitch diagnostics.
- `--fail-fast`: stop on first failure instead of finishing the whole run.
- `--mobile-stitch-threshold N`: enable/disable stitched fallback for very tall mobile captures (`0` disables).
- `--mobile-stitch-viewport-height N`: larger stitch viewport to reduce tile count/time.

### Expected outputs

- Full-page run:
  - `tmp/page_screenshots/<label>/desktop/*.png`
  - `tmp/page_screenshots/<label>/mobile/*.png`
  - `tmp/page_screenshots/<label>/manifest.json`
- Slice run:
  - `tmp/page_screenshots/<label>-slices/*_{top,mid,bottom}.png`
  - `tmp/page_screenshots/<label>-slices/manifest.json`

`manifest.json` is the canonical evidence for counts, failures, and capture mode (`full-page`, `stitched-scroll`, etc.).

### Troubleshooting

- "Looks stuck" on long pages:
  - Run one page first with `--page ... --verbose`.
  - Use slice captures as primary review artifact for extremely tall pages.
- Intermittent stitch drop (`browser 'default' is not open`):
  - The script now auto-recovers by reopening the page at the current tile.
  - In verbose mode you may see `stitch recover: reopening browser at tile ...`.
- Port in use:
  - Script auto-selects another local port; no manual action needed.
- Browser/tool missing:
  - Use `--install-browser` and verify `npx` exists.
- Blank/full-page artifacts on very tall mobile pages:
  - Prefer slice captures and/or stitched fallback output reported in manifest.

### Repository hygiene

- Capture outputs under `tmp/page_screenshots/` are review artifacts and should not be committed.
- Before commit/push:

```bash
git status --short
```

Ensure no `tmp/` capture artifacts are staged.

## Capture Timing & Polling Strategy

### Current strategy (as of 2026-03-18)

**Primary: Local polling on Proxmox LXC** — true 15-minute intervals via systemd timer. Fetches API, builds derived data, pushes to `main`, triggers GitHub Actions for Quarto render + Pages deploy. See `deploy/README.md` for setup.

**Fallback: GitHub Actions cron** (`*/15 * * * *`) — still configured but unreliable. Measured actual gaps: avg **67 minutes** (min 18, max 191). Only 1 out of 29 measured gaps was near 15 minutes. GitHub Actions cron has no SLA and is routinely throttled to 30–120 min intervals.

- `fetch_data.py` only takes ~30 seconds (uses `--fetch-only`, no heavy deps).
- Snapshots are saved **only when the data hash changes** — dedup rate ~61%.
- Expected: ~5–15 actual snapshots/day.
- Both local and GitHub polling use the same hash dedup — no duplicate snapshots regardless of who fetches.

**Resilience**: If the LXC is down, GitHub Actions cron continues as fallback (full pipeline: fetch + build + render + deploy). Timing degrades to ~1h gaps but data is never lost. When the LXC triggers a manual dispatch, GitHub skips fetch/build/tests and only renders + deploys (~2 min instead of ~4 min).

### Why 15-minute polling

Probe-era analysis (Mar 3–8) confirmed that queridômetro reactions, balance changes, and role updates happen at **unpredictable times** throughout the day — not just around 15:00 BRT as previously assumed. Examples: 10:36 BRT on Mar 3; 11:50, 12:45, 13:52 BRT on Mar 4. High-frequency polling catches all granular events (punições, compras, mesada, role changes) as they happen.

### How dedup works

- Source of truth: `_metadata.reactions_hash` in each snapshot.
- Detection method: `fetch_data.py` computes a hash of the full API payload; saves only if the hash differs from the last snapshot.
- No duplicate snapshots are created — same data = no new file.

### Verification

```bash
# Check cron schedule
head -20 .github/workflows/daily-update.yml

# Timing analysis (historical)
python scripts/analyze_capture_timing.py --full-history
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### `build_derived_data.py` fails with audit error

```bash
python scripts/audit_manual_events.py    # check what's wrong
# Fix data/manual_events.json
python scripts/build_derived_data.py     # re-run
```

### Cartola did not update after elimination (stale leaderboard)

Symptoms:
- Paredão is `finalizado` in `data/paredoes.json`, but eliminated participant still appears `active: true` in `data/derived/cartola_data.json`.
- Missing `eliminado` (−20) event in the elimination week.

Checklist:
```bash
# 1) Ensure participant exit exists in manual_events contract (not legacy keys)
jq '.participants["Name"]' data/manual_events.json

# 2) Rebuild
python scripts/build_derived_data.py

# 3) Confirm week events + active flag
jq '.leaderboard[] | select(.name=="Name") | {name,active,week_events:(.events|map(select(.week==N)))}' data/derived/cartola_data.json
```

Expected for normal elimination:
- `active: false`
- week `N` includes `["eliminado", -20, "YYYY-MM-DD"]`

If still wrong:
- Verify `data/manual_events.json -> participants["Name"]` uses `status`, `exit_date`, `paredao_numero`, `fontes`.
- Remove legacy participant keys (`date`, `week`, `paredao`, `detail`) for that entry.
- Rebuild again.

### Merge conflict on `data/derived/`

See [Handling Push Conflicts](#handling-push-conflicts).

### Workflow failed on GitHub

```bash
gh run list --limit 5          # find the run ID
gh run view <run-id> --log     # see full logs
```

Common causes:
- API temporarily down → re-trigger: `gh workflow run daily-update.yml`
- Quarto render error → test locally with `quarto render`
- Audit failure → fix manual data, push, re-trigger

### Parallel page renders fail with `database is locked` or missing `_site/data/derived/*.json`

Symptom:
- Two `quarto render <page>.qmd` commands run at the same time in the same project.
- One render aborts with errors such as:
  - `database is locked`
  - `NotFound: ... utime '_site/data/derived/relations_scores.json'`

Root cause:
- Quarto project renders are **not concurrency-safe** inside the same repo/output dir. The project cache and `_site/` resource copy step race with each other.

Use the repo wrapper instead of raw parallel `quarto render` calls:
```bash
python scripts/quarto_render_safe.py index.qmd
python scripts/quarto_render_safe.py evolucao.qmd
```

Notes:
- `scripts/quarto_render_safe.py` uses a project-wide lock under `.quarto/render.lock` and serializes concurrent callers.
- If a raw `quarto render` command already failed, rerun it through the wrapper or run a single full-site render: `python scripts/quarto_render_safe.py`

### Site not updating after push

The workflow only triggers on **cron** and **manual dispatch**, not on push:
```bash
gh workflow run daily-update.yml    # manual trigger, or wait for next cron (max 6h)
```

### Name mismatch errors

Verify names against current API:
```bash
python3 -c "
import json
with open('data/latest.json') as f:
    data = json.load(f)
for p in data['participants']:
    print(p['name'])
"
```
