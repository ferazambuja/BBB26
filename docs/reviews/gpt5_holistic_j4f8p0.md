# Review Holístico — BBB26 (Fresh Outsider)

1) Single biggest problem?  
The landing experience is not “glanceable.” It feels like a long report, not a daily dashboard. It buries the hook.

2) Single best thing?  
The data is genuinely rich and unique (daily full reaction graph). That’s gold.

3) If I could only make 3 changes  
- Add “Destaques do Dia” + Watchlist (top risk) at the top of the Painel.  
- Restructure Painel into a true dashboard (cards, top‑5, CTA for Paredão).  
- Create a “Comparar datas” control (even if pre‑rendered for last 7 days).

4) What’s obviously missing to an outsider?  
A one‑screen summary that answers “What changed today and why should I care?”

5) What would make casual viewers visit daily?  
Daily highlight cards + Paredão status + a “heat of the day” ranking. People want daily drama in 30 seconds.

6) What would make data people share on Twitter?  
A shareable “Top 5 treta / blind spots / mais odiado” card with clean design and a single stat.

7) Is 5‑page structure right?  
Yes, but only if the Painel becomes a true entry point. Right now it feels like page 3.

8) Rate 1–10 and explain  
6.5/10. Strong data and analysis, but weak productization for daily habit and shareability.

---

## Top 5 quick wins (doable in a day)
- Add “Destaques do Dia” auto‑generated block.  
- Add Watchlist (Top 5 vulneráveis).  
- Promote Paredão status to top of Painel.  
- Make Painel “dashboard‑style” with KPI cards.  
- Add Open Graph image for share previews.

## Top 3 big bets (major investment)
- Precomputed metrics + date comparator (any‑to‑any).  
- “Participant Focus” pages with deep trajectories.  
- Automated share card generation (PNG per day).

## 1 wild idea (unconventional)
“BBB26 Heat Index” — a single composite score (hostility + volatility + vulnerability) updated daily and ranked. One number per person that headlines the day.

**Fim.**
